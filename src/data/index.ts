I think it wasn‚Äôt very crowded since it was the end of the summer season. Those who bought the Quick Pass didn‚Äôt have to wait at all. The Mummy, E.T., and Harry Potter were amazing. If you don‚Äôt have much time, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend stopping by the Minions since it‚Äôs not as good as the others. Overall, we really liked it and had a lot of fun. You should set aside one full day to visit Universal Studios Florida. It‚Äôs better if you go early in the morning.",

How things have changed. \nAppears they let too many people in and the tides cannot cope, just take your money and push you in. \n Cost over ¬£450 each, first day we queued for 3 hours to get on haggard ride, got to front of queue and closed due to fault. Told come back on 1 hr and would get us on, when we returned the person was not there. Spent all day there and got on 3 rides. \n2nd visit had done express passes, another waste of money, queue nearly as long but did get on a few more rides. \n3rd visit went to epic, another waste of time , upon entry informed queue for Harry Potter ride was 6hours, didn‚Äôt want to spend all day queuing do went to circus, again 1.5hr wait to be told it was cancelled. Spent the day just looking around. In total got on about 10 rides over 3days, so about ¬£45 per ride. Won‚Äôt return here again. \nThe other parks better value for money.",

    text: "We could not get on any Harry Potter rides due to it either being stopped (delayed) or a 3 hour wait! A lot of rides were delayed. Qued  for over a hour before being told this over the tanoy! It was the same at the new epic as well! Food is dismal and the merchandise extortionate (bought 2 wands 1 was 90 dollars the other 60 dollars. People with lightening passes walked straight on to the rides   This was very disheartening. We spent 15000 altogether on our virgin holiday, so could not justify spending extra for front line passes (my grandchildren waited 2 years for this holiday.) it was also 38/39 degrees. \nUniversal need to do a rethink, as it was an endurance rather than a holiday which was not what we expected. Totally ruined thus part of our hiliday.",

    text: "This is a good park. Some of the rides were good like the Egyptian Mummy ride and Harry Potter Escape from Gringgnots. I think there are too many 3D rides though. This universal park is probably better for kids than Islands of Adventure. But older kids and most adults Islands of adventure is really good. We went to Krusty Burger for lunch it was good. I loved the stunt show too. This park is good if it is a bad day for weather üå¶Ô∏è.",

    text: "We visited three Universal Parks in August 2025: Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and the newly-opened Epic. Whilst most of the rides in all parks were fun and engaging, the overall theme coming from the experience is that some guests (wealthier) are more important than others! \n\nLet‚Äôs start with Express Passes. For a family of four that had already spent an arm and a leg getting to and staying in Orlando and then more to get into the parks, I was constantly being upsold the Express Tickets. For an extra $1200 per day, I, with my family of four, could skip any queue as many times as we liked. Morally, I just won‚Äôt go there and do that. I like to teach my children patience and fairness. However, others (with more money than me) had no issue with this and whilst you wait in very long lines with the other morally superior people (but more financially challenged) you watch endless streams of Express-Pass holders file past you and get on rides at a ratio (and I quote one of the miserable staff members now) of 3:1. That‚Äôs right. For every ride, they let Express-Pass holders ride at 3 to 1 in Express-Pass holders‚Äô favours. Yes, I‚Äôm bitter that they have more money than me for such things, sure, but where it really affects us common people is that it ups your wait times considerably. One of the Harry Potter rides had a wait time of 25 mins so we joined the queue. Within a few minutes of this, Universal had shut down all of the external coasters due to adverse weather. That meant that within 10 mins of our 25 min wait, the Express lanes had filled considerably, turning our 25 min wait into an hour and a half as the Express holders were constantly favoured over us plebs time and time again. It just leaves you with such a sour feeling of second-rate citizenship and that as a guest, you just aren‚Äôt important and it‚Äôs about nothing more than greed. \n\nRight. Back to miserable staff members: these people have no idea of how to speak to or treat people. Lost? Need directions? Ask a member of staff, right? Nope! Wrong! They just shrug their shoulders or plain ignore you. Want to buy something in a. gift shop? Most (not completely all of them in this case) treat you with apathy and barely make eye contact. Want to know info about a ride at the entrance to a queue? Well, have the decency to at least wait until the two staff members stationed there have finished their private conversations before having the audacity to actually talk to them! In all, the staff were mostly (with a few notable exceptions) miserable, misanthropic and clearly hated their jobs. I actually started challenging some of them as to why they were so rude to me for no reason? They just turned their backs most of the time. Appalling behaviour for those in the service industry. Worth pointing out that I‚Äôm a relatively easy-going, relaxed and polite person and not what you‚Äôd consider difficult or awkward. \n\nLet‚Äôs talk about the locker system. It‚Äôs rubbish and completely flawed! Lockers are located outside rides and are slightly bigger than the hole for a UK letterbox. They‚Äôre tiny. Some rides have metal detectors that mean that you have to leave everything in a locker: phone, wallet, hats, drinks, glasses‚Ä¶ rucksacks! Yup, your rucksacks, full of water and no doubt food to avoid those $12-20 snacks have to go into the teeny-tiny lockers. We needed three as a family of four and more often than not, there weren‚Äôt actually any lockers free. But hold on, there are bigger lockers available‚Ä¶ at a price of $3 plus extra if you exceed a certain time. Another greedy ripoff. Some rides don‚Äôt have metal detectors so you can keep your wallet and phone at least which allows you to plan your next queueing adventure once you‚Äôve done your two hours of watching Express-Pass holders get one over on you (I‚Äôm still bitter about that!) but they don‚Äôt tell you which so you‚Äôre left to guess. It‚Äôs such a stupid and ridiculous system. It‚Äôs downright dangerous sometimes trying to get a locker as the cramped spaces are full with people pushing and shoving and others trying to put things in or take things out of lockers right above your head. The cr√®me-de-la-cr√®me of this system, however, has to be that in order to open your locker, you need your ticket. The same ticket that you likely keep in your wallet or on the phone that you have to stare. Such a clever, well-thought out plan Universal. Paper ticket in my pocket then - a ticket that needs to make it through two weeks of parks and coasters and queues etc in sweltering heat‚Ä¶\n\nThe final icing on the cake for me was buying a refillable cup at Toad‚Äôs Cafe in Mario World on our first day. I asked the explicit question: Is it refillable in all parks? The answer: yes! Is it valid for all days? The answer: yes! Whoopee! $40 well spent on a cool cup for my children that was also refillable making it actually worth it. Until you get to another park on another day only to find the real answer to the questions: Is it refillable? Yes, but only on the day that you purchase it! Can I pay to recharge it like the other refillable cups? No. We don‚Äôt sell those cups in the other parks so we can‚Äôt do anything about it. Hmm, pretty sure I‚Äôve seen them for sale in these other parks! No you haven‚Äôt, sir! Oh, sorry. Of course, I forgot I‚Äôm a compulsive liar. (I did get somewhat perturbed at customer services at this point!) But there you have it - Universal‚Äôs non-award winning approach to a customer-led experience. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. \n\nMy feedback to Universal is to send some execs into their own parks as a standard customer (no Express Passes) and then send them to the Disney parks. Who does it better? Disney, by such a huge margin. The organisation, the timings, the general ‚Äòcan do and nothing is too much trouble‚Äô attitude of the cast members there is something that Universal really need to take note of. No matter how good your rides are, people still want to feel validated and acknowledged as welcomed visitors to your parks.",

There are safe and secure lockers to store away valuables when on the more daring of rides. \nIf you want to scare the living Jesus out of yourself then try the Jurassic Park Raptor ride!!!!",

    text: "So firstly the parks could be brilliant and have so much potential but unfortunately they did not live up to expectation for us. \n\nUniversal studios\nWe arrived early to ride Harry Potter the Forbidden Journey. We were guided all the way through the castle and queues to the gift shop! Turns out the rides broke and nobody bothered to tell us. \nWe headed to Jurassic park the kids wanted to ride Pterandodon Flyers 15 min queue time quickly turned into 60 minute.\nWe then headed to Reign of Kong, queued for an hour and it broke down whilst we were riding and had to be evacuated. We got one ride complimentary fast pass. \nHeaded to Dudley do rights ripsaw falls that was broke down. We did ride the rapids though and that was fun! Went for lunch paid $70 for three meals and an incredibly rude cashier who stopped me mid order to have a 5 minute conversation with someone else.\nHeaded over to Hollywood studios went on minions with the fast pass, we still queued for 30 mins and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. \nWent on villain con that broke too. \nFinished in Simpsons land it was ok. \nChose to spend our last day at Epic Universe, what a mistake! \nNintendo land looks amazing but was crazy busy. The rollercoast was broken down and the two rides had wait times of 80 and 245mins. We had a fast pass for our nephew they told us to come back at 3pm, we couldn‚Äôt use the pass for anything else in the mean time and it only halved the wait time.\nWe headed over to Isle of Berk three rides again, wait times of over 180 minutes for the three rides. We booked the roller coaster and headed to Ministry of Magic. The ride wait time was 210 minutes, not happening with young children. \nWe had lunch and went back to our booked time-slot for the rollercoaster at Isle of Berk. After a 30 minute conversation queue the ride broke down and we had to leave. At this point we headed to guest services to lodge a complaint and were placed in a huge queue of people. We gave up and headed home.\nUniversal studios could be great but long queues, rides not working rude staff and generally run down and tatty park areas left me unimpressed.\nEpic Universe - I feel I have been robbed. The price of the ticket that I only have one day to use and the long wait times mean it‚Äôs impossible to do it all if any. Universal put you in a position where you have to pick maybe 2/3 decent rides because the queues are so long or pay them even more money for a fast pass which isn‚Äôt really that fast. To expect people to wait over three hours for rides is crazy and quite frankly wrong especially with younger children. \nThe price I paid for the tickets and the experience didn‚Äôt match up at all and I left thinking ‚Äòwow I could have gone on a weekend European break for the price of that.‚Äô\nHopefully others go more prepared and they have a better experience than we did.",

    text: "Visited 20 years ago as a teenager, came back from U.K. this year as a dad of a teenager and a toddler. \n\nPark was awesome, loads of things for everyone to do. A huge amount of rides my tiny 4 year old could do with us. A lot of rides surprised us like the Bourne Identity. We planned to come for one day but visited two days it was that great. \n\nPlenty of shade and drinks machines everywhere. Refillable cups you can buy multiple for deals (like 16 dollars each when you buy two or more) and you go through easily that much drink a day they are great value. \n\nThe small kids land is awesome with dreamworks show a highlight where you can cool off and see an upfront live show with little ones. \n\nAll the rides were fair waiting times just be smart with the app. We didn‚Äôt need express, happy to wait 20 mins or so for rides in the height of summer. \n\nGreat park, great memories",

    text: "By far the best area is Harry Potter. The ride Gringotts Bank is fantastic, the fire breathing dragon amazing, and the shops and streets are so realistic. If you are a HP fan the park is worth it for this area. Otherwise, the park is sooooo outdated. Men in Black, Simpson‚Äôs (so jerky), Jimmy Fallon, Fast & Furious, and Minions, all need to be REPLACED! Even though ET is also outdated- at least it was a cute, fun ride. Lunch at Finnegan‚Äôs was average- definitely need more restaurants. The parade was lacking, and also outdated. Overall, for the price, this park was very disappointing.",

    text: "Having been to Islands of adventure and Epic which were excellent, Studios seemed very dated. There weren't any decent rollorcoasters and the clarity of the visual effects in the rides like escape from gringotts, again were dated compared to newer parks where you feel totally emersed in the surroundings. We left at 2pm and took Hogwarts express to Islands of adventure.\n\nThe highlight for my 18yr old daughter was the Rip ride rocket, mine was the parade and being asked to dancer by one of the salsa dancers in one of the pop up shows. Unfortunately some of the movies are old so not know to the younger ones. Time for a revamp!",

    text: "The old standard-bearer for the company is still a good park  But, after visiting it once before many years ago, not much has changed.  Fear Factor is gone and nothing has replaced it.  The Revenge of the Mummy is still the best ride there.  Of course, there's  Harry Potter section.  Fast and Furious is still garbage.  But, the Minions will make you laugh.  After all these years, E.T. is still going back to home to help his planet.  Problem:  in six years, little has been added.  \n\nEpic Universe has cost $7 billion dollars, with reports that the Harry Potter ride there took almost a billion dollars.  But, the standard-bearer of the company looks tired and forgotten.  Instead of wasting (yes, read my experience at Epic) such money, the company should have revitalized this park--at least with an additional billion.\n\nSmaller children will enjoy the park more than teens,",

Despite purchasing tickets at a higher price, the park was extremely crowded, and the weather was unbearably hot. We had to wait between 45 to 60 minutes for most rides unless we paid an additional $160 per person for the fast track option‚Äîwhich felt unreasonable on top of the already expensive entry fee.\n\nThe long wait times, coupled with the heat and extra costs, made the day feel more exhausting than enjoyable. While the rides themselves were fun, the overall experience wasn‚Äôt worth the money or the effort. Disappointing for what‚Äôs supposed to be a premium theme park experience.",

    text: "Amazing parks.\n\nWe were only in Orlando for one week before travelling around Florida so we did both parks in one day and got Fast Pass too.\nIt was a bit rushed but we went on everything. The Hagrid Motorcycle ride broke down but they gave us red passes to try again later (Fast Pass can't be used on it) and it was brilliant. Even better, we were at the front.\n\nFavourite ride was Hagrid's and the Velocicoaster which went on five times.\n\nA fantastic day!",

Alguns brinquedos precisam pagar o locker caso sua bolsa seja grande, mas gostamos bastante.",

    text: "I visited Orlando quite a bit with my parents in the late 80‚Äôs and throughout the 90‚Äôs, and the older I got the more I grew to prefer Universal Studios more.\n\n25 years since my last visit I was now in Florida with my wife and two young daughters for 2 weeks, and having the Orlando Explorer Tickets, we got unlimited access to Universal, and making use of the free parking after 6pm, we visited quite a bit at night, and had two days here were we did Adventure Island in the morning and get the Hogwarts Express across to Studios after lunch.\n\nOut the two, Hulk at Adventure Island edged it for me, but I do love Studios.\n\nRides here seem to be more interactive than actual thrill rides, but still excellent.\n\nMen in Black as good as I remember from my last visit, and Simpsons ride (while might seem primitive when it comes to effects these days) is also a fun ride.\n\nPoor ET seems VERY dated by now, yet has a charm that my two young daughters actually liked (and were streaming the movie to watch for the first time as soon as we were back at the hotel at night).\n\nTransformers and the Mummy rides were surprising hits, but to me the hidden gem of the park is the new Bourne Stuntacular show.\n\nI was up for seeing this as I love the movies, but my wife and kids were pretty ‚Äúmeh!‚Äù on it and saying ‚Äúdo we have too?‚Äù‚Ä¶. As soon as the show started though they were gobsmacked, as was I, as nothing can prepare you for this and HIGHLY recommend getting there early to get a spot.\n\nOn the more low key things to do, the Monstors Make up show can be a tad ‚Äúdad humour‚Äù, but kids will love it.\n\nMinions stuff is also good.\n\nTheir evening show though is arguably better than anything Disney put on, especially when we went our second time and they had the accompanying drones for extra effect.\n\nAll in all, some of our best days were at Universal and we will probably be back here more often than Disney when we return to Orlando one day in the future.",

Despite being beautiful, it is just not functioning well.\n>\n> Here is my experience:\n>\nExtreme long queues for lunch‚Ä¶\n\nSoda machine was out of coke and any juice, what do you do if your kids doesn‚Äôt drink soda?\n\nCarrossel attraction broke while we were in the line.\n\nIce cream vendor was out of ice cream flavors\n\nI went to the guest service and the two ladies who attended me, used a ‚Äúcall center‚Äù script instead of having a conversation.\n\nSingle riders queue in the  Mario Kart ride, showed sign that the queue was OPEN so I went with my sister and left my 5 year old. It took us 2 hours to ride. No problem to wait, but set clear expectations, and say it it will take 2 hours.\n\nWent to Harry Potter simulator, after 2:40 min in the line, our ride had 2 seats empty and I asked if they were broke, the employee told that they were not! Why? 2 seats available that is why the queues are so long\n\nWent to meet and greet Toothless Dragon, they said that we had to wait more 15 min because toothless had to have a break. Really?",

    text: "Universal studios is simply the greatest of all theme park complex‚Äôs for all those who love thrill rides (and of course Harry Potter).\n\nThe theme park complex is comprises of Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, Volcano Bay & many hotels.\n\nWe absolutely loved every ride, experience and show on offer across the different sites. \n\nI was also a big fan of the many resultants, such as Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump etc located in and around the entrance to the complex. \n\nThe staff were always very friendly and happy to help anyone throughout the stay.\n\nMy personal favourite rides across the sites were the different Harry Potter experiences, these were simply excellent.\n\nWe visited in July and you have to be prepared for exceptionally warm & long days, with plenty of water and sun screen. \n\nWe got an uber from our hotel in the Disney Land complex to Universal and it is important to note, it can cost up to three times as much on the return leg (with the dynamic pricing in place).\n\nVolcano Bay was an excellent day out, the pools were great and offered plenty of spacious swimming, whilst the rides were also excellent. If travelling by public transport, you need to get an Uber to the main complex & then a free shuttle bus to swimming.\n\nA must visit with either children or adults.",

    text: "This was my first time visiting Universal Studios since I was a kid. Our hotel offered a shuttle bus to the park, which was super convenient. No parking stress to deal with. Once we got dropped off, we went through a quick security check, then headed to the main gate to scan our tickets. This was also my first time buying the Express Pass. I got to ride every major ride the park has to offer. I skipped the kid section since that‚Äôs just not my thing. The Harry Potter area threw me off at first. It‚Äôs kind of hidden behind a brick wall, and we actually walked past it and had to walk back. But once we found it, we rode the rides and tried the famous Butterbeer. To be honest, it tasted like cream soda with whipped cream on top. Overall, the park is definitely more for families and people who prefer mild rides. I‚Äôm more into thrillers and intense coasters, so for me, it was just okay.",

    text: "Another overpriced lame experience. This time at the Epic park. Day pass alone is more expensive than Disney and then to enhance experience was told to add express pass at the overinflated price of 299 per person. Absolutely not worth.  Express pass lane still took on average 30-40 minutes to go through.  Stairs up the wazoo and number of total number of available rides less than 10. Way better off at Disney.   Even one of the cast members said express pass is not worth it especially since it excludes the 3 most popular rides anyway.  Also food line was over an hour to get worst tasting burger ever.",

    text: "Good theme park, but expensive.  Also, TERRIBLE  for people with disabilities.  I'd followed the procedure & advised online that would be in need an assistance pass. I was supposed to get a phone call to discuss need.   No call!!  I emailed them,  no response!!!\n\nArrived at the park. Waited for an hour in the queue to get the assistance pass, to be told i wasnt eligible under the parks regulations!! I have CFS/ME & osteoarthritis in both knees,  was in a wheelchair to cope with the park.  My son is type 1 diabetic & unable to withstand long queues as danger of low blood sugars in the heat.  I also had my elderly father with me. Thankfully,  after MUCH discussion with a member of staff,  we got a limited assistance pass. But in total wasted 1 hour & 43 mins at the park! \nThis could have been avoided had I been contacted prior to the visit.  \nI felt like this was a waste of money! (Not a problem at SeaWorld,  they were happy to help us!)\n Considering the high cost for tickets & $60 for parking  you'd think the least they could do would be to help those in need! Appalling !\n\nWill NOT be returning to Universal Studios Orlando.",

    text: "I would give 0 star for customer service from a food stand.\nAll other park experience is 4 stars.(the reason not making it to 5 stars as there were so crowed, long wait on many popular item. )\n\nOur family of 4 visited one of your food stands on our second day in Universal Studio.\nMy son enjoyed the refillable cup on the first day so he wants it again on the second day.\nNot until we just paid full price of $18.99(with tax $20.22) and were waiting for your staff to hand over the cup and receipt. My husband asked if there would be a better price if we already have a cup from the first day?  And your staff confirmed that ‚Äúwe only need to pay $12/ before tax. Thus we asked to adjust the payment right away ( either refund the first full price payment and charge $12 or adjust the original payment to $12).\nHe said he couldn‚Äôt do it , he had to wait for the manager for authorization and he indicated that he texted his manager. So we were waiting and waiting on the stand on this hot and humid day‚Ä¶. We have been very patient but up to a point we feel no one cares about us or does anything.\nI asked Ricky, is your manager coming ? He said he had no response from the manager , not only that , he was never trying to resolve the problem while we were waiting for long. So 30 mins past , I checked again and nothing happened and not even with any progress, I told Ricky , I want the receipt that I paid for full price . We are really not paying hundreds to waste our time here. I will file a claim later.  Even though I said so, he still kept me waiting for another 10+ mins ( even other customers reached out to me and wanted to know what happened as they noticed us standing there for a long time ). So at the end of the day , we still paid full price, not the $12 that we are qualified for. And we waited for over 40 mins  suffering from the heat for NOTHING!\n\nHere are issues for your attention:\n\n1. Staff Ricky didn't make efforts to help but only asked us to wait forever.\n\n2. Any shop should be able to reverse the transaction and why this specific staff, Ricky, cannot do it - either do refund or adjust the payment.( It is always possible that your staff may make a mistake on charging customers or customers make a mistake on their order,as well. Shouldn‚Äôt staff be capable of managing the change /correction ?\n\n3. If only the manager can do such a payment adjustment or refund, why did it take such a long time for the customer, especially during peak season in summer ?( we waited for over 40 mins but nothing happened, so I doubt how much longer it would take to get a manager's response and even if the manager would come to help ? ) it is too ridiculous for Universal Studio as such a high end and pricey theme park to provide this poor service.\n\n4. If a customer can use an existing cup( which is great for the environment too ) to get a better price of $12, why not let the customer know at the first place so that we don‚Äôt have to suffer the price adjustment processes in our case.(not until we asked or we will never know this deal)\n\nSome customers who saw us waiting for a long time highly recommended that we should  reach out to you guys to explain the whole thing , as it was so wrong!They would be frustrated like we do.\n\nI am sharing my experience here, as I hope other travelers would not waste their time waiting for something like this as you will have to spend tons of time on waiting for rides .(If I knew it took so much time, I shouldn't trust your staff and wait there.)\n\nI am attaching the food stand, our receipt, the staff name and coupon for your reference.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon!\nThanks!\n\nSincerely,\nLing",

    text: "Epic Adventure = Epic Failure      Spent $1924. on tickets for family of 5.  This was one day Epic and one day park to park.   After standing for 90 minutes to get on a five minute long ride we walked back to purchase a fast pass for Epic; only to find they were sold out for the day.    We purchased fast passes for the next day (park/park) for a total of $1571.   Adding this balance to our original tickets we now have spent $3495. for tickets for a family of 5.  (approx $700 per person for 2 days; one without fast pass)\n\nIn my opinion, Epic Adventure is not fully developed.   The Disney/Universal experience is not there yet.    Rides are limited thus lines can be over 90 to 120 minutes of wait time; often in full sun.   Sit down restaurants few and far between.   There is a Starbucks.  I noted while walking through a tunnel numerous family groups sitting on the ground resting against the sides of the tunnel just to sit and find relief from sun.   I went to an ice cream stand and there were three small tables only 2 with umbrellas.   We invited others to sit with us as there was nowhere for people to take a break in the shade.   I spoke with two park employees who said more things would be happening in the future; I think Universal should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a poor experience.   People where actually lying in landscaped areas just to find relief.  This is July in Florida, and as a resident I believe I am more acclimated to the heat; and felt very sorry for those people with young children in carriages, as well as the elderly.  Unlike the other parks I did not see any characters for picture taking or interaction.  The rides appeared to be more roller coaster types (think amusement park, which you can get anywhere).  Due to the long wait times I believe we only went on 4/5 rides.  You do the math for the cost per person per ride.  I asked my grandchildren ages 10 and 12 (full adult ticket purchases) which they enjoyed more, Hersey Park in PA or Epic Adventure.  They chose Hershey, followed by Busch Gardens, Williamsburg Va or Dollywood.  \n\nThe second day we went to combo Universal Studies and Universal Island of Adventure.      All around it was a wonderful experience and I wish we could have gotten to many more rides.  There are numerous indoor dining venues, as well as stands that sell a variety of food items, such as fresh watermelon.  Shade is everywhere.  Character interaction is numerous; the afternoon parade was great!  Musical performances (like Stomp) are ongoing.  I can't say enough about how great these two parks are.\n\nUnfortunately my son had a medical emergency and was transported by ambulance to a local hospital.   I have to commend all staff at first aid for their expedious triage and care.   Truly first rate.   \n\nDue to the emergency we would not continue to enjoy the great experience we were having, but we did get numerous rides in and staff was outstanding.\n\nIf I returned, I would go only to the Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.   Get the fast pass it is worth it.    Skip Epic for a while until it is fully built out.  What you save by skipping Epic Universe will pay for your fast pass for the other two parks.",

    text: "Universal Studios has a lot of simulator rides.  Also some good shows.  Don't miss the Jason Bourne show.  It's easy to walk by and miss.  It is indoors and air conditioned.  A lot of the rides are indoors.  Don't miss the Harry Potter area of the park and if you have park to park tickets take the train.  It is a very unique train.  There was a parade around 2 or 3 that we didn't expect but was a lot of fun.  Take in a Stanley Cup or some type of cup with water.  It's allowed and you can refill it with water.   It is hot.  And it was only in the low 90s.  There are also roller coasters but we didn't get on those.",

    text: "My family frequently visits Orlando, and we go back-and-forth between Disney and universal. Now that my kids are older they prefer universal and I do too. So we purchased tickets through Sam‚Äôs Club and got a little bit of a savings along with the dining dollars.com pretend discount. I say pretend because you cannot use the dining dollars at Universal Studios. I am not sure who to blame for this Sam‚Äôs Club or universal but either way it‚Äôs very misleading and disappointing when you spend hours setting up the account and trying to figure out where you can actually use the dining dollars. Not fun. Let‚Äôs put a damper on the experience but overall my kids still had fun. I just want to know everything upfront if I‚Äôm buying food for the day, I can budget for that but if I‚Äôm told I have $80 voucher for food I expect to save that $80. Don‚Äôt fall for the food voucher misleading promo that‚Äôs my lesson learned.",

    text: "The 1 Park Per Day ticket was a smart choice for our family of five, especially during such a busy holiday weekend. It allowed us to stay grounded in one park without the pressure of hopping, which helped us pace the day and enjoy each area more fully. With kids in tow, it was nice not having to rush between gates or juggle transportation. The ticket also made planning easier, and we felt like we got our money‚Äôs worth by focusing on Universal Studios alone. For families visiting during peak times, this option keeps things simple and still delivers a full, satisfying experience.",

    text: "Visiting Universal Studios Florida over Thanksgiving weekend was a high-energy, festive experience. The park was buzzing with families and holiday decorations, and while the crowds were definitely thick, the atmosphere felt celebratory rather than overwhelming. We focused on key attractions like Revenge of the Mummy and Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, and even with longer wait times, the immersive theming and entertainment between rides kept everyone engaged. The seasonal touches‚Äîlike holiday music, themed treats, and character appearances‚Äîadded a special layer to the day that made it feel like more than just a theme park visit.",
