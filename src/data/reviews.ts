The Bourne show might be the best in Orlando. Simpson, fast and furious and jimmy fallon are really poor. ET needs to go. Newer and more rides are required.",

I think it wasn‚Äôt very crowded since it was the end of the summer season. Those who bought the Quick Pass didn‚Äôt have to wait at all. The Mummy, E.T., and Harry Potter were amazing. If you don‚Äôt have much time, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend stopping by the Minions since it‚Äôs not as good as the others. Overall, we really liked it and had a lot of fun. You should set aside one full day to visit Universal Studios Florida. It‚Äôs better if you go early in the morning.",

How things have changed. \nAppears they let too many people in and the tides cannot cope, just take your money and push you in. \n Cost over ¬£450 each, first day we queued for 3 hours to get on haggard ride, got to front of queue and closed due to fault. Told come back on 1 hr and would get us on, when we returned the person was not there. Spent all day there and got on 3 rides. \n2nd visit had done express passes, another waste of money, queue nearly as long but did get on a few more rides. \n3rd visit went to epic, another waste of time , upon entry informed queue for Harry Potter ride was 6hours, didn‚Äôt want to spend all day queuing do went to circus, again 1.5hr wait to be told it was cancelled. Spent the day just looking around. In total got on about 10 rides over 3days, so about ¬£45 per ride. Won‚Äôt return here again. \nThe other parks better value for money.",

            text: "We could not get on any Harry Potter rides due to it either being stopped (delayed) or a 3 hour wait! A lot of rides were delayed. Qued  for over a hour before being told this over the tanoy! It was the same at the new epic as well! Food is dismal and the merchandise extortionate (bought 2 wands 1 was 90 dollars the other 60 dollars. People with lightening passes walked straight on to the rides   This was very disheartening. We spent 15000 altogether on our virgin holiday, so could not justify spending extra for front line passes (my grandchildren waited 2 years for this holiday.) it was also 38/39 degrees. \nUniversal need to do a rethink, as it was an endurance rather than a holiday which was not what we expected. Totally ruined thus part of our hiliday.",

This universal park is probably better for kids than Islands of Adventure. But older kids and most adults Islands of adventure is really good. We went to Krusty Burger for lunch it was good. I loved the stunt show too. This park is good if it is a bad day for weather üå¶Ô∏è.",

            text: "We visited three Universal Parks in August 2025: Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and the newly-opened Epic. Whilst most of the rides in all parks were fun and engaging, the overall theme coming from the experience is that some guests (wealthier) are more important than others! \n\nLet‚Äôs start with Express Passes. For a family of four that had already spent an arm and a leg getting to and staying in Orlando and then more to get into the parks, I was constantly being upsold the Express Tickets. For an extra $1200 per day, I, with my family of four, could skip any queue as many times as we liked. Morally, I just won‚Äôt go there and do that. I like to teach my children patience and fairness. However, others (with more money than me) had no issue with this and whilst you wait in very long lines with the other morally superior people (but more financially challenged) you watch endless streams of Express-Pass holders file past you and get on rides at a ratio (and I quote one of the miserable staff members now) of 3:1. That‚Äôs right. For every ride, they let Express-Pass holders ride at 3 to 1 in Express-Pass holders‚Äô favours. Yes, I‚Äôm bitter that they have more money than me for such things, sure, but where it really affects us common people is that it ups your wait times considerably. One of the Harry Potter rides had a wait time of 25 mins so we joined the queue. Within a few minutes of this, Universal had shut down all of the external coasters due to adverse weather. That meant that within 10 mins of our 25 min wait, the Express lanes had filled considerably, turning our 25 min wait into an hour and a half as the Express holders were constantly favoured over us plebs time and time again. It just leaves you with such a sour feeling of second-rate citizenship and that as a guest, you just aren‚Äôt important and it‚Äôs about nothing more than greed. \n\nRight. Back to miserable staff members: these people have no idea of how to speak to or treat people. Lost? Need directions? Ask a member of staff, right? Nope! Wrong! They just shrug their shoulders or plain ignore you. Want to buy something in a. gift shop? Most (not completely all of them in this case) treat you with apathy and barely make eye contact. Want to know info about a ride at the entrance to a queue? Well, have the decency to at least wait until the two staff members stationed there have finished their private conversations before having the audacity to actually talk to them! In all, the staff were mostly (with a few notable exceptions) miserable, misanthropic and clearly hated their jobs. I actually started challenging some of them as to why they were so rude to me for no reason? They just turned their backs most of the time. Appalling behaviour for those in the service industry. Worth pointing out that I‚Äôm a relatively easy-going, relaxed and polite person and not what you‚Äôd consider difficult or awkward. \n\nLet‚Äôs talk about the locker system. It‚Äôs rubbish and completely flawed! Lockers are located outside rides and are slightly bigger than the hole for a UK letterbox. They‚Äôre tiny. Some rides have metal detectors that mean that you have to leave everything in a locker: phone, wallet, hats, drinks, glasses‚Ä¶ rucksacks! Yup, your rucksacks, full of water and no doubt food to avoid those $12-20 snacks have to go into the teeny-tiny lockers. We needed three as a family of four and more often than not, there weren‚Äôt actually any lockers free. But hold on, there are bigger lockers available‚Ä¶ at a price of $3 plus extra if you exceed a certain time. Another greedy ripoff. Some rides don‚Äôt have metal detectors so you can keep your wallet and phone at least which allows you to plan your next queueing adventure once you‚Äôve done your two hours of watching Express-Pass holders get one over on you (I‚Äôm still bitter about that!) but they don‚Äôt tell you which so you‚Äôre left to guess. It‚Äôs such a stupid and ridiculous system. It‚Äôs downright dangerous sometimes trying to get a locker as the cramped spaces are full with people pushing and shoving and others trying to put things in or take things out of lockers right above your head. The cr√®me-de-la-cr√®me of this system, however, has to be that in order to open your locker, you need your ticket. The same ticket that you likely keep in your wallet or on the phone that you have to stare. Such a clever, well-thought out plan Universal. Paper ticket in my pocket then - a ticket that needs to make it through two weeks of parks and coasters and queues etc in sweltering heat‚Ä¶\n\nThe final icing on the cake for me was buying a refillable cup at Toad‚Äôs Cafe in Mario World on our first day. I asked the explicit question: Is it refillable in all parks? The answer: yes! Is it valid for all days? The answer: yes! Whoopee! $40 well spent on a cool cup for my children that was also refillable making it actually worth it. Until you get to another park on another day only to find the real answer to the questions: Is it refillable? Yes, but only on the day that you purchase it! Can I pay to recharge it like the other refillable cups? No. We don‚Äôt sell those cups in the other parks so we can‚Äôt do anything about it. Hmm, pretty sure I‚Äôve seen them for sale in these other parks! No you haven‚Äôt, sir! Oh, sorry. Of course, I forgot I‚Äôm a compulsive liar. (I did get somewhat perturbed at customer services at this point!) But there you have it - Universal‚Äôs non-award winning approach to a customer-led experience. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. \n\nMy feedback to Universal is to send some execs into their own parks as a standard customer (no Express Passes) and then send them to the Disney parks. Who does it better? Disney, by such a huge margin. The organisation, the timings, the general ‚Äòcan do and nothing is too much trouble‚Äô attitude of the cast members there is something that Universal really need to take note of. No matter how good your rides are, people still want to feel validated and acknowledged as welcomed visitors to your parks.",

            text: "So firstly the parks could be brilliant and have so much potential but unfortunately they did not live up to expectation for us. \n\nUniversal studios\nWe arrived early to ride Harry Potter the Forbidden Journey. We were guided all the way through the castle and queues to the gift shop! Turns out the rides broke and nobody bothered to tell us. \nWe headed to Jurassic park the kids wanted to ride Pterandodon Flyers 15 min queue time quickly turned into 60 minute.\nWe then headed to Reign of Kong, queued for an hour and it broke down whilst we were riding and had to be evacuated. We got one ride complimentary fast pass. \nHeaded to Dudley do rights ripsaw falls that was broke down. We did ride the rapids though and that was fun! Went for lunch paid $70 for three meals and an incredibly rude cashier who stopped me mid order to have a 5 minute conversation with someone else.\nHeaded over to Hollywood studios went on minions with the fast pass, we still queued for 30 mins and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. \nWent on villain con that broke too. \nFinished in Simpsons land it was ok. \nChose to spend our last day at Epic Universe, what a mistake! \nNintendo land looks amazing but was crazy busy. The rollercoast was broken down and the two rides had wait times of 80 and 245mins. We had a fast pass for our nephew they told us to come back at 3pm, we couldn‚Äôt use the pass for anything else in the mean time and it only halved the wait time.\nWe headed over to Isle of Berk three rides again, wait times of over 180 minutes for the three rides. We booked the roller coaster and headed to Ministry of Magic. The ride wait time was 210 minutes, not happening with young children. \nWe had lunch and went back to our booked time-slot for the rollercoaster at Isle of Berk. After a 30 minute conversation queue the ride broke down and we had to leave. At this point we headed to guest services to lodge a complaint and were placed in a huge queue of people. We gave up and headed home.\nUniversal studios could be great but long queues, rides not working rude staff and generally run down and tatty park areas left me unimpressed.\nEpic Universe - I feel I have been robbed. The price of the ticket that I only have one day to use and the long wait times mean it‚Äôs impossible to do it all if any. Universal put you in a position where you have to pick maybe 2/3 decent rides because the queues are so long or pay them even more money for a fast pass which isn‚Äôt really that fast. To expect people to wait over three hours for rides is crazy and quite frankly wrong especially with younger children. \nThe price I paid for the tickets and the experience didn‚Äôt match up at all and I left thinking ‚Äòwow I could have gone on a weekend European break for the price of that.‚Äô\nHopefully others go more prepared and they have a better experience than we did.",

A huge amount of rides my tiny 4 year old could do with us. A lot of rides surprised us like the Bourne Identity. We planned to come for one day but visited two days it was that great. \n\nPlenty of shade and drinks machines everywhere. Refillable cups you can buy multiple for deals (like 16 dollars each when you buy two or more) and you go through easily that much drink a day they are great value. \n\nThe small kids land is awesome with dreamworks show a highlight where you can cool off and see an upfront live show with little ones. \n\nAll the rides were fair waiting times just be smart with the app. We didn‚Äôt need express, happy to wait 20 mins or so for rides in the height of summer. \n\nGreat park, great memories",

            text: "By far the best area is Harry Potter. The ride Gringotts Bank is fantastic, the fire breathing dragon amazing, and the shops and streets are so realistic. If you are a HP fan the park is worth it for this area. Otherwise, the park is sooooo outdated. Men in Black, Simpson‚Äôs (so jerky), Jimmy Fallon, Fast & Furious, and Minions, all need to be REPLACED! Even though ET is also outdated- at least it was a cute, fun ride. Lunch at Finnegan‚Äôs was average- definitely need more restaurants. The parade was lacking, and also outdated. Overall, for the price, this park was very disappointing.",

            text: "Having been to Islands of adventure and Epic which were excellent, Studios seemed very dated. There weren't any decent rollorcoasters and the clarity of the visual effects in the rides like escape from gringotts, again were dated compared to newer parks where you feel totally emersed in the surroundings. We left at 2pm and took Hogwarts express to Islands of adventure.\n\nThe highlight for my 18yr old daughter was the Rip ride rocket, mine was the parade and being asked to dancer by one of the salsa dancers in one of the pop up shows. Unfortunately some of the movies are old so not know to the younger ones. Time for a revamp!",

Visited the first time in many years and felt as if the movie history the park used to have has now decreased significantly, a couple of Back to the Future references is all that seemed to be left. The rides however are great and the kids really enjoyed them.",

            text: "The old standard-bearer for the company is still a good park  But, after visiting it once before many years ago, not much has changed.  Fear Factor is gone and nothing has replaced it.  The Revenge of the Mummy is still the best ride there.  Of course, there's  Harry Potter section.  Fast and Furious is still garbage.  But, the Minions will make you laugh.  After all these years, E.T. is still going back to home to help his planet.  Problem:  in six years, little has been added.  \n\nEpic Universe has cost $7 billion dollars, with reports that the Harry Potter ride there took almost a billion dollars.  But, the standard-bearer of the company looks tired and forgotten.  Instead of wasting (yes, read my experience at Epic) such money, the company should have revitalized this park--at least with an additional billion.\n\nSmaller children will enjoy the park more than teens,",

We had to wait between 45 to 60 minutes for most rides unless we paid an additional $160 per person for the fast track option‚Äîwhich felt unreasonable on top of the already expensive entry fee.\n\nThe long wait times, coupled with the heat and extra costs, made the day feel more exhausting than enjoyable.

            text: "Amazing parks.\n\nWe were only in Orlando for one week before travelling around Florida so we did both parks in one day and got Fast Pass too.\nIt was a bit rushed but we went on everything. The Hagrid Motorcycle ride broke down but they gave us red passes to try again later (Fast Pass can't be used on it) and it was brilliant. Even better, we were at the front.\n\nFavourite ride was Hagrid's and the Velocicoaster which went on five times.\n\nA fantastic day!",

            text: "I visited Orlando quite a bit with my parents in the late 80‚Äôs and throughout the 90‚Äôs, and the older I got the more I grew to prefer Universal Studios more.\n\n25 years since my last visit I was now in Florida with my wife and two young daughters for 2 weeks, and having the Orlando Explorer Tickets, we got unlimited access to Universal, and making use of the free parking after 6pm, we visited quite a bit at night, and had two days here were we did Adventure Island in the morning and get the Hogwarts Express across to Studios after lunch.\n\nOut the two, Hulk at Adventure Island edged it for me, but I do love Studios.\n\nRides here seem to be more interactive than actual thrill rides, but still excellent.\n\nMen in Black as good as I remember from my last visit, and Simpsons ride (while might seem primitive when it comes to effects these days) is also a fun ride.\n\nPoor ET seems VERY dated by now, yet has a charm that my two young daughters actually liked (and were streaming the movie to watch for the first time as soon as we were back at the hotel at night).\n\nTransformers and the Mummy rides were surprising hits, but to me the hidden gem of the park is the new Bourne Stuntacular show.\n\nI was up for seeing this as I love the movies, but my wife and kids were pretty ‚Äúmeh!‚Äù on it and saying ‚Äúdo we have too?‚Äù‚Ä¶. As soon as the show started though they were gobsmacked, as was I, as nothing can prepare you for this and HIGHLY recommend getting there early to get a spot.\n\nOn the more low key things to do, the Monstors Make up show can be a tad ‚Äúdad humour‚Äù, but kids will love it.\n\nMinions stuff is also good.\n\nTheir evening show though is arguably better than anything Disney put on, especially when we went our second time and they had the accompanying drones for extra effect.\n\nAll in all, some of our best days were at Universal and we will probably be back here more often than Disney when we return to Orlando one day in the future.",

            text: "Just to express my disappointment with Epic Universe. Despite being beautiful, it is just not functioning well.\n>\n> Here is my experience:\n>\nExtreme long queues for lunch‚Ä¶\n\nSoda machine was out of coke and any juice, what do you do if your kids doesn‚Äôt drink soda?\n\nCarrossel attraction broke while we were in the line.\n\nIce cream vendor was out of ice cream flavors\n\nI went to the guest service and the two ladies who attended me, used a ‚Äúcall center‚Äù script instead of having a conversation.\n\nSingle riders queue in the  Mario Kart ride, showed sign that the queue was OPEN so I went with my sister and left my 5 year old. It took us 2 hours to ride. No problem to wait, but set clear expectations, and say it it will take 2 hours.\n\nWent to Harry Potter simulator, after 2:40 min in the line, our ride had 2 seats empty and I asked if they were broke, the employee told that they were not! Why? 2 seats available that is why the queues are so long\n\nWent to meet and greet Toothless Dragon, they said that we had to wait more 15 min because toothless had to have a break. Really?",

            text: "Universal studios is simply the greatest of all theme park complex‚Äôs for all those who love thrill rides (and of course Harry Potter).\n\nThe theme park complex is comprises of Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, Volcano Bay & many hotels.\n\nWe absolutely loved every ride, experience and show on offer across the different sites. \n\nI was also a big fan of the many resultants, such as Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump etc located in and around the entrance to the complex. \n\nThe staff were always very friendly and happy to help anyone throughout the stay.\n\nMy personal favourite rides across the sites were the different Harry Potter experiences, these were simply excellent.\n\nWe visited in July and you have to be prepared for exceptionally warm & long days, with plenty of water and sun screen. \n\nWe got an uber from our hotel in the Disney Land complex to Universal and it is important to note, it can cost up to three times as much on the return leg (with the dynamic pricing in place).\n\nVolcano Bay was an excellent day out, the pools were great and offered plenty of spacious swimming, whilst the rides were also excellent. If travelling by public transport, you need to get an Uber to the main complex & then a free shuttle bus to swimming.\n\nA must visit with either children or adults.",

            text: "This was my first time visiting Universal Studios since I was a kid. Our hotel offered a shuttle bus to the park, which was super convenient. No parking stress to deal with. Once we got dropped off, we went through a quick security check, then headed to the main gate to scan our tickets. This was also my first time buying the Express Pass. I got to ride every major ride the park has to offer. I skipped the kid section since that‚Äôs just not my thing. The Harry Potter area threw me off at first. It‚Äôs kind of hidden behind a brick wall, and we actually walked past it and had to walk back. But once we found it, we rode the rides and tried the famous Butterbeer. To be honest, it tasted like cream soda with whipped cream on top. Overall, the park is definitely more for families and people who prefer mild rides. I‚Äôm more into thrillers and intense coasters, so for me, it was just okay.",

            text: "Another overpriced lame experience. This time at the Epic park. Day pass alone is more expensive than Disney and then to enhance experience was told to add express pass at the overinflated price of 299 per person. Absolutely not worth.  Express pass lane still took on average 30-40 minutes to go through.  Stairs up the wazoo and number of total number of available rides less than 10. Way better off at Disney.   Even one of the cast members said express pass is not worth it especially since it excludes the 3 most popular rides anyway.  Also food line was over an hour to get worst tasting burger ever.",

            text: "Good theme park, but expensive.  Also, TERRIBLE  for people with disabilities.  I'd followed the procedure & advised online that would be in need an assistance pass. I was supposed to get a phone call to discuss need.   No call!!  I emailed them,  no response!!!\n\nArrived at the park. Waited for an hour in the queue to get the assistance pass, to be told i wasnt eligible under the parks regulations!! I have CFS/ME & osteoarthritis in both knees,  was in a wheelchair to cope with the park.  My son is type 1 diabetic & unable to withstand long queues as danger of low blood sugars in the heat.  I also had my elderly father with me. Thankfully,  after MUCH discussion with a member of staff,  we got a limited assistance pass. But in total wasted 1 hour & 43 mins at the park! \nThis could have been avoided had I been contacted prior to the visit.  \nI felt like this was a waste of money! (Not a problem at SeaWorld,  they were happy to help us!)\n Considering the high cost for tickets & $60 for parking  you'd think the least they could do would be to help those in need! Appalling !\n\nWill NOT be returning to Universal Studios Orlando.",

            text: "I would give 0 star for customer service from a food stand.\nAll other park experience is 4 stars.(the reason not making it to 5 stars as there were so crowed, long wait on many popular item. )\n\nOur family of 4 visited one of your food stands on our second day in Universal Studio.\nMy son enjoyed the refillable cup on the first day so he wants it again on the second day.\nNot until we just paid full price of $18.99(with tax $20.22) and were waiting for your staff to hand over the cup and receipt. My husband asked if there would be a better price if we already have a cup from the first day?  And your staff confirmed that ‚Äúwe only need to pay $12/ before tax. Thus we asked to adjust the payment right away ( either refund the first full price payment and charge $12 or adjust the original payment to $12).\nHe said he couldn‚Äôt do it , he had to wait for the manager for authorization and he indicated that he texted his manager. So we were waiting and waiting on the stand on this hot and humid day‚Ä¶. We have been very patient but up to a point we feel no one cares about us or does anything.\nI asked Ricky, is your manager coming ? He said he had no response from the manager , not only that , he was never trying to resolve the problem while we were waiting for long. So 30 mins past , I checked again and nothing happened and not even with any progress, I told Ricky , I want the receipt that I paid for full price . We are really not paying hundreds to waste our time here. I will file a claim later.  Even though I said so, he still kept me waiting for another 10+ mins ( even other customers reached out to me and wanted to know what happened as they noticed us standing there for a long time ). So at the end of the day , we still paid full price, not the $12 that we are qualified for. And we waited for over 40 mins  suffering from the heat for NOTHING!\n\nHere are issues for your attention:\n\n1. Staff Ricky didn't make efforts to help but only asked us to wait forever.\n\n2. Any shop should be able to reverse the transaction and why this specific staff, Ricky, cannot do it - either do refund or adjust the payment.( It is always possible that your staff may make a mistake on charging customers or customers make a mistake on their order,as well. Shouldn‚Äôt staff be capable of managing the change /correction ?\n\n3. If only the manager can do such a payment adjustment or refund, why did it take such a long time for the customer, especially during peak season in summer ?( we waited for over 40 mins but nothing happened, so I doubt how much longer it would take to get a manager's response and even if the manager would come to help ? ) it is too ridiculous for Universal Studio as such a high end and pricey theme park to provide this poor service.\n\n4. If a customer can use an existing cup( which is great for the environment too ) to get a better price of $12, why not let the customer know at the first place so that we don‚Äôt have to suffer the price adjustment processes in our case.(not until we asked or we will never know this deal)\n\nSome customers who saw us waiting for a long time highly recommended that we should  reach out to you guys to explain the whole thing , as it was so wrong!They would be frustrated like we do.\n\nI am sharing my experience here, as I hope other travelers would not waste their time waiting for something like this as you will have to spend tons of time on waiting for rides .(If I knew it took so much time, I shouldn't trust your staff and wait there.)\n\nI am attaching the food stand, our receipt, the staff name and coupon for your reference.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon!\nThanks!\n\nSincerely,\nLing",

            text: "Epic Adventure = Epic Failure      Spent $1924. on tickets for family of 5.  This was one day Epic and one day park to park.   After standing for 90 minutes to get on a five minute long ride we walked back to purchase a fast pass for Epic; only to find they were sold out for the day.    We purchased fast passes for the next day (park/park) for a total of $1571.   Adding this balance to our original tickets we now have spent $3495. for tickets for a family of 5.  (approx $700 per person for 2 days; one without fast pass)\n\nIn my opinion, Epic Adventure is not fully developed.   The Disney/Universal experience is not there yet.    Rides are limited thus lines can be over 90 to 120 minutes of wait time; often in full sun.   Sit down restaurants few and far between.   There is a Starbucks.  I noted while walking through a tunnel numerous family groups sitting on the ground resting against the sides of the tunnel just to sit and find relief from sun.   I went to an ice cream stand and there were three small tables only 2 with umbrellas.   We invited others to sit with us as there was nowhere for people to take a break in the shade.   I spoke with two park employees who said more things would be happening in the future; I think Universal should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a poor experience.   People where actually lying in landscaped areas just to find relief.  This is July in Florida, and as a resident I believe I am more acclimated to the heat; and felt very sorry for those people with young children in carriages, as well as the elderly.  Unlike the other parks I did not see any characters for picture taking or interaction.  The rides appeared to be more roller coaster types (think amusement park, which you can get anywhere).  Due to the long wait times I believe we only went on 4/5 rides.  You do the math for the cost per person per ride.  I asked my grandchildren ages 10 and 12 (full adult ticket purchases) which they enjoyed more, Hersey Park in PA or Epic Adventure.  They chose Hershey, followed by Busch Gardens, Williamsburg Va or Dollywood.  \n\nThe second day we went to combo Universal Studies and Universal Island of Adventure.      All around it was a wonderful experience and I wish we could have gotten to many more rides.  There are numerous indoor dining venues, as well as stands that sell a variety of food items, such as fresh watermelon.  Shade is everywhere.  Character interaction is numerous; the afternoon parade was great!  Musical performances (like Stomp) are ongoing.  I can't say enough about how great these two parks are.\n\nUnfortunately my son had a medical emergency and was transported by ambulance to a local hospital.   I have to commend all staff at first aid for their expedious triage and care.   Truly first rate.   \n\nDue to the emergency we would not continue to enjoy the great experience we were having, but we did get numerous rides in and staff was outstanding.\n\nIf I returned, I would go only to the Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.   Get the fast pass it is worth it.    Skip Epic for a while until it is fully built out.  What you save by skipping Epic Universe will pay for your fast pass for the other two parks.",

It's so wonderful to hear that you had a great time with us, as well as that you found something for everyone in your family to enjoy! Hopefully you had the opportunity to visit one of my favorite attractions, E.T. Adventure, while you were here. That said, I apologize for any discomfort you encountered in our queues, and I'll make sure your feedback is documented to be shared with the appropriate leadership teams. We really appreciate you reaching out, and we hope to see you back again soon!  \n\n-Samantha",

            text: "Universal Studios has a lot of simulator rides.  Also some good shows.  Don't miss the Jason Bourne show.  It's easy to walk by and miss.  It is indoors and air conditioned.  A lot of the rides are indoors.  Don't miss the Harry Potter area of the park and if you have park to park tickets take the train.  It is a very unique train.  There was a parade around 2 or 3 that we didn't expect but was a lot of fun.  Take in a Stanley Cup or some type of cup with water.  It's allowed and you can refill it with water.   It is hot.  And it was only in the low 90s.  There are also roller coasters but we didn't get on those.",

            text: "My family frequently visits Orlando, and we go back-and-forth between Disney and universal. Now that my kids are older they prefer universal and I do too. So we purchased tickets through Sam‚Äôs Club and got a little bit of a savings along with the dining dollars.com pretend discount. I say pretend because you cannot use the dining dollars at Universal Studios. I am not sure who to blame for this Sam‚Äôs Club or universal but either way it‚Äôs very misleading and disappointing when you spend hours setting up the account and trying to figure out where you can actually use the dining dollars. Not fun. Let‚Äôs put a damper on the experience but overall my kids still had fun. I just want to know everything upfront if I‚Äôm buying food for the day, I can budget for that but if I‚Äôm told I have $80 voucher for food I expect to save that $80. Don‚Äôt fall for the food voucher misleading promo that‚Äôs my lesson learned.",

            text: "The 1 Park Per Day ticket was a smart choice for our family of five, especially during such a busy holiday weekend. It allowed us to stay grounded in one park without the pressure of hopping, which helped us pace the day and enjoy each area more fully. With kids in tow, it was nice not having to rush between gates or juggle transportation. The ticket also made planning easier, and we felt like we got our money‚Äôs worth by focusing on Universal Studios alone. For families visiting during peak times, this option keeps things simple and still delivers a full, satisfying experience.",

            text: "Visiting Universal Studios Florida over Thanksgiving weekend was a high-energy, festive experience. The park was buzzing with families and holiday decorations, and while the crowds were definitely thick, the atmosphere felt celebratory rather than overwhelming. We focused on key attractions like Revenge of the Mummy and Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, and even with longer wait times, the immersive theming and entertainment between rides kept everyone engaged. The seasonal touches‚Äîlike holiday music, themed treats, and character appearances‚Äîadded a special layer to the day that made it feel like more than just a theme park visit.",

            text: "Universal Studios Japan is a very fun place but can be a bit hectic as well. If you plan it right you can enjoy it. First of all buy your tickets from Klook. I actually wasn't able to buy the tickets from the official website. I read that that happens a lot to people from outside of Japan. The days are color coded according to how busy they are expected to be and the prices differ as well. Try to opt for a day that isn't too crowded. We chose the middle out of 5 levels and it was overall ok, even though it was a Saturday. I would also highly recommend a fast pass package. There are many options and it can be confusing so some research to determine which rides you want to go on and which areas you want to access is unfortunately essential. The fast pass gives you timed access to some areas like Super Nintendo World and Harry Potter, which are the two most crowded as well as access to the fast track line for one of the rides in those areas and other rides as well. An important tip is that the park opens about an hour before the stated time for that day. So people actually show up 2 hours before the official opening time to get a good spot in the queue and when they do open they rush usually to Super Nintendo World. You don't need a timed access before the park \"officially\" opens. You could also rush to an area where you don't have a later timed entry already. Alternatively you can check the app and book a timed entry or find staff who hand out timed entry tickets. Both of those have to be done in the park on the day of your visit. I personally opted for a timed entry to Super Nintendo World and a fast pass for Mario Kart and another for Harry Potter and one of the roller coasters as well as the Jaws ride and another roller coaster. There are many options on Klook but take care that they sell out very early. So buy them in advance. The rides are all fun and there are a lot of shows as well. There are plenty of food options too. I had a pizza near the Jaws ride and a nice strawberry dessert from a Super Mario themed cafe. My favorite area was Super Nintendo World. The Donkey Kong ride was a very long wait, but worth it in my opinion. Try to get a fast pass for that if you book early enough. Overall a busy but enjoyable day.",

            text: "Please, please, please. Book a week to a month before your planned visit because passes WILL run out. I forgot about that and booked a day before so we were left with the regular passes. I had a 3 and a 6yr old with me so the 3yr old came in for free. Also, book on Klook.. they might offer the passes a bit cheaper compared to the website. And they have packages as well.. like the one with the \"Have fun in Kansai\" pass which let's you ride the train from Kansai airport for free.\nStudy the passes and their packages and see what suits you.. might be Nintendo world, Harry potter or Donkey Kong.\nDownload the app! But you won't be able to use it unless you're inside USJ. We, who only had the regular passes had to hustle inside and use the app immediately so that we could pick a time for Nintendo world. Yes, there will be time slots available but it WILL run out fast. So, pick the earliest time available and book it right away. \nPackages with specific fast passes to rides is essential especially if you enjoy rides. Average wait times will be 30-45 mins, or can even go up to an hour. So pick your rides. I went to the flying dinosaur and waited about 30mins. Fast pass cuts that time by 80% so I saw people pass me by and just skipped the line.\nFun rides for adrenaline rushers will be Flying Dinosaur,  Hollywood dream and Hollywood backdrop. Mid-rides will be DKs country, Mario kart, Harry potter etc.\nTip: Elmo's ride sits only toddlers up to kindergarten age. So if your kid is a first grader just say he's still in kindergarten. Enjoy!",

            text: "Universal Studios Japan was a bit of a mixed experience for me. The wait times were honestly a joke, far too long and by the time we arrived, every single fast track option had already sold out. To make the most of our time, we ended up using the single rider lines for basically every ride, which worked well for efficiency but meant we never actually got to ride on one or two things together.\n\nThat being said, Super Nintendo World was absolutely incredible, easily the highlight of the park and an experience I‚Äôll never forget. The theming, atmosphere, and overall design were truly amazing.\n\nOverall, though, the park was just far too crowded, and the lack of fast track availability really hurt the experience. If you‚Äôre planning a visit, buy fast tracks in advance as they‚Äôre always sold out on the day. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt go back, but if you‚Äôre in Osaka it‚Äôs definitely worth visiting at least once, especially for Nintendo fans.",

We had an express ticket for a ride in Nintendo world that was worth having as the line was stupidly long and actually the ride wasn't worth the wait compared to other rides there. Also go early to Nintendo world as it gets stupidly busy. I thought Harry Potter world was better and more fun.",

            text: "I have never been to a theme park before and seeing how Japan runs I had very high hopes of an efficient, fun family day out. I will start with positives, the Jurassic park, harry Potter and donkey Kong rides were memorable. The water world show as also very well done. I couldn't help thinking though that they don't really care about there patrons. The lack of shade and seating in hot weather is borderline inhumane and I personally found it a disgrace. I sat and watched people queued up in express lanes they had paid massive money for (much like us) in the hot sun with nothing around to make them comfortable. Also some of the locker setups are a joke with people cramming into to tight spaces to secure their stuff. If I were overseeing a place like this I would do the following. Make patrons as comfortable as possible at the security and entry points. Fans, water mist, shaded cover and obvious line markings so people don't push in. Put seats around the whole park on the edge of every garden bed. Put rows of vending machines everywhere. The ease of getting things and moving will speed up everything and have a knock on effect. And lastly, get Gordon Ramsay in there quick sticks! The food is absolute rubbish and extortionate prices. All in all, if those few rides were rubbish this would have been a complete crash and burn. We spent the best part of $2500 aud for one day with 4 people, lunch and waters all day. A couple of souvenirs. I don't think we went silly with spending but wow what a joke.",

            text: "My wife and I had a fantastic day here.\n\nHighlights included:\n\n- Meeting the Minions as part of their Easter parade (number 1 highlight)\n- Going on a Despicable Me ride (number 2 highlight)\n- The Harry Potter area (not even a big fan, but it was so well done)\n- Going on the Jaws ride (such a classic, am scared of sharks but it wasn't scary- loved it)\n- The Nintendo area (we weren't sure whether we would get in- didn't pay extra for a pass just picked up a timed ticket in the park that didn't guarantee entry) - first it was lovely how a staff member seemed genuinely so excited for us that we were able to go (and the staff in general were very nice). The design of the area was just incredible and the rides were fun.\n\nMy tip is to do single rider on any ride you don't mind going on together, it can make such a difference to the wait time. Then you have extra time to queue for the ones that you do.\n\nThe park has been very cleverly designed and even getting here was simple- the line from central Osaka was fast and inexpensive.",

Did not get to do a single activity due to wait times. 3 hours 40 minutes queue at 8.30am is just ridiculous.  It‚Äôs not possible unless you want spend ¬£100s on express passes so the studio passes are worthless. Paid to get in to queue and walk around shop after shop after shop of the same stuff. Food very poor as well, can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre selling 2 donuts with a bit of sauce and cheese on as a burger, utterly disgusting experience. Also nowhere to sit hardly in 38 degree heat unless go and wait ages in an expensive restaurant serving absolute junk. Gutted",

            text: "We visited as a family, mum, dad and 11 year old son.\n\nStaying in a hotel in Dotonbori, getting to and from Universal Studios was super easy using the metro.. this is one of the few positive things about this day out.\n\nWe did not buy premium passes and instead decided to arrive just before 8am.  After queuing to get in (be sure to take sun umbrellas and plenty of water in summer as you will spend much time queuing in direct sunlight) a fast-paced walk/jog directly to Nintendo World paid off as we were able to get entry to that section of the park without queuing, be sure to get there first thing if you want to achieve the same.. sadly this is where things go down hill.. we only aimed to get on one ride in this area.. ‚ÄòMinecraft madness‚Äô.. sadly the queuing time was just over 3 hours!! (after initial signs stating 2 hours) Had it not been summer we probably would have stuck it out.. but.. despite the considerable effort of Universal Studios to keep the place cool the summer weather was just too much unless you have at least 3 litres of water per person whilst queuing for the ride + previously mentioned sun umbrella(s).. we waited an hour and gave up.. much to my sons dismay.. it just wasn‚Äôt worth the potential heat-related health problems (and we‚Äôre not unfit/overweight etc).\n\nWe went on to discover that all the proper rides had similar wait times.. in the end we watched the ‚ÄòSing‚Äô show which was about 20mins of furry animal costumes mostly lip syncing.. fun but not talented.  \n\nOne very positive thing I have to say is that all the park staff are very friendly and helpful so that was really great :)\n\nUnfortunately the food options are not good.  Unless you really want to spend more than most families would consider reasonable (even expected) for a theme park or get anything like ‚Äòproper‚Äô food.. just take your own.. you‚Äôll be very glad you did.  Drinks are available all over which is great but food is very sparse and poor and very overpriced.\n\nAlthough we were able to get some good photos from around the park and enjoyed checking out the shops (again the usual theme park premium applies) we sadly came away having gone on zero rides due to the excessive wait times (although this would have been less of a problem if the temperature was sub 30 degrees), this is obviously caused by the park allowing way, WAY more people than the park can reasonably accommodate.. we left feeling very much like we‚Äôd been sold an experience that would never have been possible to deliver due to visitor numbers.. if you do go and you have the money.. definitely spend the extra on premium passes to avoid disappointment..",

            text: "We had the most wonderful time with the kids in JUS. We booked the tickets online, arrived their by taxi, walking distance from the dropping point to the entrance was 3 minutes, going thru security and then the main gate was very well organized, and everyone their was very very very friendly.\nWe also booked express passes to some selected rides which I highly recommend. Even though we are in the tourist low season (August), the waiting lines were between 45 to some times 2 hours for the popular rides.",

            text: "First & foremost, the entry to Super Nintendo World is to be bought separately. I am happy I did not buy it, because the weather was so hot & humid, we exited at 3:00 pm itself. The long queues for some of the rides was too much of a hassle due to humidity, so we skipped them. I am sure we wouldn't have covered Super Nintendo World. If we had visited during cooler months, I am sure my family & I would stay until the closing time. Multiple kiosks selling ice creams & cold juices is a big relief. We enjoyed the Harry Potter rides. But the merch isn't original, so we did not buy anything. Thankfully we had visited \"The Making of Harry Potter\" in Tokyo a week prior.",

            text: "Este parque solamente merece la pena visitarlo si te gusta Harry Potter y Super Nintendo World. De lo contrario mejor ah√≥rrate la entrada, tu tiempo y tu dinero.\nEl parque no es muy grande y lo m√°s alucinante que vimos fue lo masificado que est√° y la gran cantidad de colas que hay para todas las atracciones, habiendo algunas de hasta 2 horas. Hasta para comer e ir al ba√±o hay colas... Con respecto a las atracciones de Harry Potter y Super Nintendo World, destacar est√°n recreadas de forma incre√≠ble y, pese a que se tenga el pase expr√©s, habr√° que esperar como m√≠nimo 15 minutos de cola. Recomiendo comprar dicho pase a Super Nintendo si no quieres quedarte sin visitarlo, ya que hay mucha gente que quiere verlo. De verdad, ahorraros madrugar mucho para pasar gratis como lo venden muchos influencers puesto que es muy complicado. Por otro lado, no entiendo que haya tantos decorados americanizados en este parque, para m√≠ est√°n de m√°s y no proceden. Tampoco entiendo que en plena √©poca de verano haciendo un calor y humedad horrible no haya apenas sombras en el parque y no se pongan unos simples toldos. Tambi√©n los precios de los souvenirs y de la comida son bastante caros. Nada entendible que en sitios como Don Quijote tengas lo mismo a mitad de precio y con tax free.\nLo recomiendo solo y s√≠ aceptas lo que he comentado previamente. Es posiblemente una de los mejores planes que se pueden hacer en Osaka. Est√° demasiado sobrevalorado para lo que es, no volver√≠a si volviera a visitar Jap√≥n.",

Super mario land and dk was the only saving grace you can see the though effort and they actually cared about into that area compared to the rest minus snoopy (that was pretty well done also )",

            text: "We tried booking via the Japan site over a period of 4 weeks.  Everytime we'd get to the final stage of payment and their site wouldn't accept our credit cards.  We tried Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Wise from multiple countries.  We even emailed them step by step screen shots of the issues (along with 1000's of other redditers having the same issues) and they point blankly told us there was nothing wrong with their site.  We eventually bough tickets on the English version of the site and they accepted our CC first time with no issues. Minus points to Universal Studios for their arrogance and ignorance.\n\nWe arrived about 40 minutes early to a queue of about 1,000 people waiting to go inside.  It was already hot at 8am and it took a good 40 to 60 minutes to get inside.  Once inside we had a Express 4 Pass that we used (It saved a lot of time in the queues and got us onto the Mine Cart ride after it had closed to the general public).  That said they are pretty expensive.\n\nWe ended up doing Super Nintendo World (2 hours), Harry Potter (1.5 hours),  Minions (new ride - Villain Con Minion Blast - really cool except you're standing all the time - even on the ride, but it's a lot of fun) (1 hour), Jaws (30 mins), and two of the roller coasters (both good fun).  We did one of the 4D shows, but it's all in Japanese and we struggled to understand what was going on (before going in, everything is subtitled in English, but once inside the English disappears). The rest of the time was finding food, goods, walking between areas - it's deceptively larger than it looks.  We left at closing and only got home by 10:30pm..  A long but enjoyable day..\n\nDownside : We tried one ride where we asked if our son (neurodiverse) could wait in another area while we waited in a queue.  They struggled to understand English and using a translator device finally understood what we wanted.  They took my wife and son to a room (that they absolutely hated) and myself and my other son stood in the queue.  Everytime we asked when they would join us, no one understood or knew what to do.  We eventually had to go fetch them and we called it a \"lets never try that again\" event.",

Heb overal maar maximaal 20\nMinuten hoeven wachten; vaak korter. \nVoor Marioworld wel een reservering nodig; maar ondanks dat was het zo ontzettend druk dat ik dat maar overgeslagen heb. Jammer want ziet er leuk uit. \nWaterworld show is leuk, ga vooral op de blauwe banken zitten op een warme dag; want daar wordt je echt enorm nat gespetterd.",

You needed 2 days to really explore Harry Potter area and any area you want to immerse yourself in. We didn‚Äôt even get to do Mario land as there was a constant 2 hour wait for their rides. \nEverything is in Japanese, you don‚Äôt feel welcome and makes understanding the rides and the experience difficult . It‚Äôs not pleasant to say the least. I‚Äôve been to many countries where they accommodate the main languages.

            text: "I came to Universal Studios Japan (USJ) with my family hoping for a fun, magical day together‚Äîbut we left feeling exhausted, frustrated, and honestly, exploited.\n\nI've been to Disneyland and other major parks before, but what I experienced at USJ was something else entirely: a park that feels **intentionally designed to squeeze every yen out of you**, regardless of how it impacts the guest experience‚Äîespecially for families with kids.\n\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of what felt greedy and disappointing:\n\n---\n\n### üéüÔ∏è 1. **Massive Overcrowding**\n\nThe park was **packed beyond capacity**, with 2+ hour lines for most rides and very little space to rest or enjoy the atmosphere. It‚Äôs clear that USJ doesn‚Äôt meaningfully cap attendance‚Äîeven on peak days. It felt more like a money grab than a curated experience.\n\n---\n\n### üí∏ 2. **Paywalls Inside the Park**\n\n* Want to skip the insane lines? You *have* to pay extra for an **Express Pass**, which costs more than the ticket itself in many cases.\n* Want to actually participate in Super Nintendo World or Harry Potter World? Get ready to buy expensive **Power-Up Bands (¬•4,200)** or **Interactive Wands (¬•5,000‚Äì6,000)**.\n* These aren't just souvenirs‚Äîthey're **required tools** for core features. You can't really interact without them.\n\n---\n\n### üç± 3. **No Outside Food or Drinks Allowed**\n\nUSJ **bans all outside food**, including snacks and bento for children. This forces guests to buy overpriced food inside the park. Even soft drinks from outside aren‚Äôt allowed. Contrast that with Tokyo Disneyland, which allows food and even has designated picnic areas.\n\n---\n\n### üßí 4. **Not Family-Friendly**\n\nAs a parent, I was shocked at how little consideration is given to families:\n\n* No flexibility on ride access for kids,\n* Few quiet or shaded areas to rest,\n* Long waits with no real accommodations for children.\n\nIt feels like the park is **designed for spending**, not comfort or enjoyment‚Äîespecially for families.\n\n---\n\n### üì± 5. **App Dependency and Poor Transparency**\n\nAccess to popular areas like Super Nintendo World or Harry Potter World often requires a **timed-entry ticket via the USJ app**. These run out early in the morning and aren't well communicated. If you‚Äôre not super tech-savvy or fluent in Japanese, you‚Äôre out of luck.\n\n---\n\n### üßæ Summary:\n\n**Universal Studios Japan feels like it‚Äôs built to extract money at every step**: overpriced food, required upsells, no crowd control, and zero flexibility or family-friendliness. Compared to Disneyland (which we loved), this was a stressful and joyless experience.\n\nI won‚Äôt be returning, and I can‚Äôt recommend this park to families or visitors who value fairness, transparency, or actual fun.",

            text: "El parque est√° muy bien ambientado pero las atracciones son bastante normales, con alguna excepci√≥n. Colas largu√≠simas en todas partes, los pases express van con hora fija por atracci√≥n y no hay forma de que se pueda acceder antes, lo cual es bastante desventajoso porque los horarios que te asignan no facilitan la visita, puede haber mucho tiempo entre una y otra y alguna tienes que esperar casi a que cierren el parque. El √°rea Nintendo muy bonita, pero tiene poca cosa, la atracci√≥n de Yoshi es como un tren para ni√±os peque√±os, en la de Donkey Kong 3 horas de cola todo el d√≠a. \n\nEn muchas partes no hay ni un sitio para sentarse.\n\nCompr√© el pase express porque en muchos blogs y rese√±as pon√≠a que era una forma de garantizar entrar a Nintendo world, pero en realidad nadie estaba pidiendo ninguna entrada en esta √°rea, entraba todo el mundo aunque estuviese abarrotado.\n\nMe esperaba algo mejor.",

Hp was very small with only 2 rides not a patch on universal Florida. Couldn‚Äôt really eat lunch as no tables. Snw was so busy they let too n MM any people in causing the huge queues.

            text: "After visiting other Universal Parks that we loved, we are disappointed with the Osaka version. There are far too many people, the wait times are out of control, and the workers are friendly but completely lack any sense of urgency. Three employees selling water bottles at a cart, but each transaction taking 3-5 minutes. Mobile order at the restaurant, but then told to wait in line with everyone else to pay for and retrieve my food. It starts down pouring rain (not the park‚Äôs fault, of course) but there are so many people here that no one could move and everyone is soaked. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PLACE.",

            text: "We had a fantastic time at Universal Studios Japan ‚Äì truly one of the highlights of our trip!\n\nThe park is beautifully designed with incredible attention to detail, from the magical streets of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to the thrilling atmosphere of Super Nintendo World. Every corner offered something exciting for both adults and children alike.\n\nThe rides and shows were world-class ‚Äì Hollywood Dream, Jurassic Park ‚Äì The Ride, and Mario Kart: Koopa‚Äôs Challenge were just a few of our favourites. That said, the park does get quite busy, especially on weekends and holidays.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing the Fast Track pass. It made an enormous difference to our experience, allowing us to skip some of the longest queues and enjoy more attractions in less time. Without it, we would have spent far too much of the day just waiting in line.\n\nThe staff were friendly, helpful, and well-organised, keeping everything running smoothly despite the crowds. Food options were plentiful with some fun themed snacks, and there were loads of photo-worthy moments throughout the day.\n\nIf you‚Äôre visiting Osaka, Universal Studios Japan is an absolute must, especially with family or friends. Be sure to get that Fast Track for the best experience ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth every yen!\n",

The weather was perfect, which was a big bonus and made the whole experience even more enjoyable.\nWe booked our tickets through Klook and also purchased the Express Pass, it made everything so much easier and smoother. We were able to skip long lines and enjoy more attractions without feeling rushed.\nThe park itself was vibrant, well-organized, and full of energy. \nOverall, a fun and seamless experience. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Osaka!",

En plus, pas de ticket avec cr√©neaux horaires √† Super Nintendo World. On m'avait dit que c'√©tait pratique, √ßa permet de g√©rer le monde. \nLe parc n'est pas grand et les d√©cors sont bien donc il y a toujours moyen de d√©ambuler, d'avoir des souvenirs et de prendre de jolies photos.  \nPar contre, il y a du monde, beaucoup de monde. Et quand la pluie s'est calm√©e, les attractions fortes ont eu plus de 100 minutes de file d'attente.\n Ah oui, sans l'application, impossible de savoir les files d'attente d'ailleurs. C'est dommage car je connais des parcs o√π des √©crans sont disponibles avec une vue globale sans qu'on en ait √† t√©l√©charger quoique ce soit. \nBref, super parc mais beaucoup de petits impr√©vus qui ont g√¢ch√© mon exp√©rience.

We had timed tickets to Nintendo world and still had to line up for ages to get in. Very tired disappointed kids ",

            text: "De passage √† Osaka pour 4 jours nous avons choisi de faire le parc avant notre d√©part. Le parc ouvre officiellement √† 8h30, mais vu qu‚Äôil y a beaucoup de monde il ouvre plus t√¥t pour notre part √† 7h50 le parc a ouvert ses portes. Il est facilement accessible en transport car il a la propre gare. Si vous souhaitez acc√©d√© au Nintendo world il faut arriver les premier, il demande un Qr code 30 min apr√®s l‚Äôouverture juste le temps d‚Äôy aller dans les premiers. J‚Äôai ensuite r√©server un cr√©neaux pour 15h facilement avec l‚Äôapplication. J‚Äôai pu le faire 2 fois mais le matin il y a beaucoup moins de monde pour faire les attractions. \nLe parc est magnifique et les attractions sont super surtout celles √† sensations. Je vous conseil de prendre les voix ¬´¬†single¬†¬ª pour √©viter l‚Äôattente pendant parfois plus d‚Äôune heure. \nL‚Äôentr√©e n‚Äôest pas excessive pour un parc aussi beau et propre. Il y a tout pour passer une bonne journ√©e. Un conseil pour le repas du midi. Demandez √† sortir et revenir apr√®s manger. Il vous tamponneront la main (les repas sont moins ch√®re au city walk)",

            text: "El parque cuenta con diversas √°reas tem√°ticas de distintas sagas de pel√≠culas para todas las edades. Recomiendo mucho adquirir pases para tener apartados los juegos m√°s populares y as√≠ evitar las filas, esto tiene un costo extra pero vale la pena. Excelente servicio por parte del personal, juegos muy divertidos siendo la joya de la corona Super Nintendo World. La comida es lo que uno espera de un parque de diversiones y considero que este parque quiz√°s sea uno de los principales motivos para visitar Osaka. No se lo pueden perder",

            text: "We visited Universal Studios Japan as a family of four (with kids aged 7 and 11) and had a fun and memorable day. We went on several rides including Jaws, both Harry Potter rides, Mario Kart and other Nintendo rides, and Minion Mayhem.\n\nHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey was the highlight‚Äîan incredible ride with 3D screens and motion effects that made us feel completely immersed in the Wizarding World. Jaws was also a fun and thrilling experience. While we were excited to explore Super Nintendo World, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations and felt just okay.\n\nThe park gets crowded, and wait times can be long‚Äîso we highly recommend purchasing the Universal Express Pass. It made a big difference and was well worth the cost to skip the long lines for the most popular attractions.\n\nOverall, it was a great day out and a must-visit for families, especially Harry Potter fans. Just plan ahead for crowds and express access to get the most out of your visit.",

Around 6:30 after park was actively closing we tried to find special cups at the store near exit and we failed to do so. \n\nWe asked cashier Jen about cups and she walk all the way to already closed area with shrek part and bring us those cups. We are really grateful to her, as we already lost hope to bring special souvenir back to home country \n\nThank you Jen!!! At August 28 around the 6:30 7 pm!

Could do with more things to do whilst you queue like some interactive games, more rides, more characters and real life shows not cinematic shows.\nIt‚Äôs also a shame that the castle is not used as a fun house or something interesting for kids to see.",

The Ancient Egypt themed area and rides were the best in my opinion! The 4D Shrek short movie was such a cool experience. Also, make sure to go to Sentosa Island with the cable car, it will make the day all the better!",

The outer area of the park has Lego, Chocolate stores and is very festive!\nInside the ride list is similar to Universal in California and Florida (I've visited both). The square foot area is smaller though, can cover the park in half a day compared to US ones.\nDon't miss the chance to visit the park if you visit Singapore!",

            text: "Truly terrible experience. To begin the price of a single ticket is 85$. We arrived 30 minutes after park opening. We had to queue for over 45 minutes just to enter the park. Most rides are 40minute + waiting time and in some rides you aren‚Äôt allowed to take a bag or anything else, which is understandable, but in Singapore Heath, queuing for over 100 minutes without water or food is just not right. \n\nAn express pass is $130 per person, again the price is too high for what you get as this theme park is only small. \n\nMy conclusion: to expensive, to busy.",

            text: "Went with family of six on a Friday in August.  Took the MRT to hat outside and then taking 4 escalators up joined the sensors express (Monorail) to the resort work stop.  Tickets for the Sentosa express are 4 dollars per person.  Children U7 free - you can buy at the monorail entrance or simply use your MRT card at the gate to save buying a ticket.  (Return is free - you only need a racket to get out to the island). \n\nArrived at 9:40 at the universal entrance and the queue was quite small - 50 people in each of 6 lines. We entered the park and headed to minions land (we had standard park tickets), and we managed to go on 3 minions land rides in just 75 minutes, amazing as later in the day all these had +50 min ride waits. We then headed to far far away land and did shred 4d and the magic potion spin both within the next hour. \n\nA brief stop for lunch and then back to enchanted airways - but the queue was 60 mins due to so many express pass riders being let in early.  This is a very short ride and not worth the queue.\n\nWe then headed to the rapids (80 min queue), again massively impacted by the fast pass riders being let in first. \n\nIt was 3:30 by this time so a stop for more drinks and refills, before we went on Accelerator, then Lights, Camera Action and a walk in the shops.  We headed back to Cyclon (queue said 60 mins but only took 20 mins - the best ride on the park), and Treasure Hunters. \n\nOn the way out at 6:30 we spotted Transformers 3D was open and made this our last ride of the day.\n\nOverall thoughts: the park is good, more aimed at smaller kids, some rides very similar to small UK theme parks. \n\nPasses/ if you buy a standard pass, it‚Äôs almost impossible to do all the rides you want to go on due to horrendous queues. Some queues were 120 mins and many others were 70 mins.  \n\nIf you buy and express pass there are also rides with queues - rapids was 59 min queue even for the express pass for example (a staff member has a sign warning people).\n\nThe overall experience is that the park is ok, but massively oversold with people. Some of the staff are strict and rude, the prices for food and drinks and super high, and the ride turnaround is slow (single staff members loading cars, operating the queues and also controlling the start/stop slowed things down where it could have been quicker. \n\nTips: take some food and drinks - despite all signs about bag searches we didn‚Äôt see a single bag searched when we entered. \n\nTips: rapids has a singe rider line - use this to save 2 hours of queuing if you can.\n\nTips: you can complete minion land in the first hour if you arrive early.\n\nTips:  barge your MET cars up the day before to avoid having to buy a monorail ticket.\n\nTips:  stay late - the queues get smaller in the last 90 mins.",

Purtroppo ho trovato chiusa waterworld ed √® rimasta chiusa anche Jurassic park per met√† giornata ‚Ä¶ peccato che quando ci siamo accorti che l‚Äôavevano aperta c‚Äôerano gi√† 80-90 minuti di coda ‚Ä¶ facendo per√≤ la single ride abbiamo ridotto a mezz‚Äôora l‚Äôattesa !! le attrazioni non sono tante,!giostre carine, ma sempre corte ‚Ä¶ bella la mummia ma troppo corta, bella quella dei minions, bello anche shrek in 4D.

Ride is closed , water world is closed , Transformers was closed for most of the day and there were other rides closed too , absolutely no information before entering the park. The entry pass with express is massively expensive . We went on a friday the locals get a cheaper rate and the place was overcrowded massive  queues . The restaurants were full of students we had to wait 40 minutes to find a table.",

            text: "Wow! I felt transported to a new world at Universal singapore. With such intricate designs and architecture i felt fascinated. Minion world especially stood out to me! Queue times however became very long around 2pm and some of the rides may not have been worth the 110 minute wait! This universal studios is small and unfortunately when i came two of the rides were shut and as there are already not a lot of rides, this limited our rollercoaster experience. My favourite rides were: the return of the mummy, Human, Cyclone and Minion Mayhem. For the bigger rollercoasters you have to put your items in a locker which was definitely different to Florida. I'd advise anyone going to arrive there 15 mins before the gates open at 10 am as we managed to do the biggest 3 rollercoasters within the first 45 mins.",

            text: "I put it down to heat and humidity, plus jet lag kicking in, but this pocket version of the original Hollywood attraction is a pale imitation. It's colourful and crowded, but the queuing times of up to 100 minutes for the more popular rides, plus the generic burger and Coke diners etc, and countless gift shops in such a small space make for a claustrophobic day out. Two or three of the rides were closed for 'refurbishment', including the Waterworld show which I remember loving thirty years ago, and there were rather too many Minions or Sesame Street tie-ins. Maybe I'm a grouch but I reckon this Universal franchisee needs a bit of a kick and upgrade.",

            text: "We had a great day out, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but there was some wrinkles that they need to sort really. \nWe had fast pass - good job as pretty much every line was 50mins plus most the day, 110mins for a few key rides. Even with fast pass we waited over 20mins for a few rides. Remember minionland is a supplementary fast pass which we are glad we did not do as that‚Äôs pricey for just 3rides (two of which are smaller child more mainstream rides like a carousel). We headed straight to minions mayhem on arriving at the park for opening (not alone with this trick as it was instantly a 30min wait but did rise to 45 then 60mins whilst we were in line). \nThe queues take a while to get in the park at the start of the day, even with all the gates open, mostly cos there‚Äôs people with issues with their tickets which the staff member sorts with them whilst the queue waits - would be better to have a separate staff member for those with problems to be ushered to keep the lines flowing eg people in front of us had bought fast pass but not bought their actual entry ticket (don‚Äôt make that error). Would be good to have a few more staff members in a few places, would speed things up. Waiting in the Singapore heat is more painful than usual waiting and most lines are undercover but very hot, with occasional regular fans, taking a hand fan useful but for some of the bigger rides you‚Äôve already had to store all loose items in a locker anyway. We were really disappointed the Jurassic park rapids ride was closed, it‚Äôs a big one to be missing. Also disappointed that Jurassic canopy flyers and also nearby treasure hunters are not on fast pass. They didn‚Äôt drop below 50mins queue in our visit even at 6.30 at night. Trolls live performance, shrek 4d are two good places to get an aircon recovery for a while to reset. Watch out if you do the Steven Spielberg making of movie magic near the park entrance, if you are front row right hand side as you look forward then you get soaked, not splashed, absolutely soaked through as a wave comes at you. That made for a very uncomfortable time as there was no air dryers in the bathrooms and the humidity doesn‚Äôt let things dry fast. \nWe‚Äôve done universal in California and also universal in Florida a few times, and we knew this park was much smaller, for the most part the rides that are there are exact same rides, but less dramatic eg minions mayhem without glasses, mummy with less fire.",

Abbiamo fatto il roller coaster battlestar galactica, la durata della coda scritta sul monitor era 1 ora e 10 minuti, ci abbiamo messo quasi 4 ore. Come se non bastasse devi depositare tutte le tue cose in un armadietto con codice dove rimane gratuito per 120 minuti e volevano pure che pagavamo 14 dollari per il tempo aggiuntivo in deposito. Devi farti pure tutta l‚Äôattesa senza nulla in tasca (telefono, acqua) e senza aria condizionata. C‚Äôera gente che  sudava e si sedeva ovunque perche senza piu forze. I peggior soldi mai spesi in vita mia, ovviamente non ci ritornerei, non vale i soldi n√® il tempo speso. Sconsigliatissimo. Se potessi non darei neanche una stella.",

We had express passes but even if we didn‚Äôt the waits weren‚Äôt that long. \n\nBefore even entering the park 2 rides we wanted to do (Jurassic Park and Enchanted Airways) were closed for maintenance. The show Waterworld was also closed for maintenance. Why close 2 major things at the one time. This just increases line times on other rides. \n\nToday we got in straight away and our first wait was 30 minutes (Battlestar Galactica, Human) \n\nNext we went to check out the Mummy but it was closed. App says open but workers said otherwise. \n\nWe went to Battlestar Galactica Cylon) 60\nMinute wait. Went back to the Mummy. Still closed. Was told by worker it will open. Went back to Cylon with another 60 minute wait. \n\nAll rides we completed were at least 60 minutes, some more. It is now 3:30pm and the Mummy is yet to open but still not listed as down for maintenance. Feel this is very dishonest. \n\nNot worth visiting in my opinion.",

            text: "Over the years we‚Äôve visited Florida Universal Studios as well as Disney parks at both Florida and Paris. They‚Äôve all been busy but this was another level of busy! 90 minute wait for nearly every ride and it seemed that even fast pass holders (as there were so many of them) were still experiencing half an hour or more  to get on a ride. Queuing in extreme temperatures, often outdoors with no seats and no cooling mists as found in similar temperatures in Florida. A couple of the larger rides, such as the water ride (much needed in plus 30 degree weather) were closed for maintenance!\nThe most  disappointing experience and we wouldn‚Äôt encourage anyone to visit!",

            text: "Universal Studios was an awesome day out.  It was hot and humid but most ride lines had fans and shade while you were waiting.\nMany rides closed due to rain and thunder warning, with only the inside rides operating at this time - recommend going on the outdoor rides first if it is clear and saving the indoors ones for when it rains. \nWe had a mixed lots of waiting times - Battlestar Galactica was pretty much just walk-on every time (my daughter rode it 4 times!), Puss in Boots and Enchanted Airways had  a long wait, Accelerator was empty (just us on the ride), and Transformers we walked straight on. But all rides had friendly and helpful staff, and were greatly enjoyed.\nWe saw the Waterworld show, which was much better than I was expecting, with the chance to sit down in the shade a welcome break. The Lights, Camera, Action! show was great too, and you learned a lot about special effects.\nThere are plenty of food options, from sit down cafes to street-side stalls with drinks and ice creams. \nWe met the Minions and didn't have to queue too long.\nThere are plenty of shops to choose souvenirs from (most rides exit through a shop).\nAdvice is to skip your photo at the US globe at the entrance until your way out. So many people first thing, but when we left at closing time, we were able to get a photo with just us in it.",

Rides just suddenly been closed, other areas under maintenance, so few shows that you queue up forever to try and get in. And cost to play a game is the biggest rip off ($8 gave you one ball to have 1 go üò≥) We‚Äôve been to Amusement Parks all around the world and never seen anything so terribly ran. They need to start with entry limits. We were a family of 4 (2 adults 12 & 6 year olds)",

            text: "Don‚Äôt buy fast pass!!! The best tip is to arrive early like 9am and get in a queue. Beforehand make a list of the attractions you want to visit and just do them in order. Fast pass is very expensive and doesn‚Äôt apply to many popular rides so at least an hour in a queue regardless of the pass. Technical issues is a common thing so be prepare an attraction you want to go on will be shut and no compensation!! So go early and don‚Äôt waste money on the passes - not worth it!!!",

            text: "Just got back from a visit to Universal Studios Singapore and thought I‚Äôd clear up some misinformation I saw in other reviews ‚Äî not because people are wrong, but because things have changed, and most reviews are outdated. Here‚Äôs what you need to know if you‚Äôre visiting as of July 2025. \n\nEXPRESS VS EXPRESS PLUS\nThe main difference now is Minion Land. If you want to skip the queue at the main Minion ride, you‚Äôll need the Express Plus pass. Regular Express doesn‚Äôt cover it.\n\nThat said, even on a busy day, the wait time for the Minion kiddie rides was under 10 minutes, and about 50 minutes for the main ride. Personally, I‚Äôd save the S$30 and just:\n\t‚Ä¢\tBe there when the park opens,\n\t‚Ä¢\tHead straight to Minion Land,\n\t‚Ä¢\tRide the Minion attraction first,\n\t‚Ä¢\tThen use a regular Express pass for everything else.\n\nEXPRESS LINE = NOT INSTANT\nAnother thing: the Express line isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúskip the queue.‚Äù We still waited 20+ minutes at rides like Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers. But hey ‚Äî that‚Äôs still better than the regular 60‚Äì90 min lines.\n\nFREE WATER (SORT OF)\nYou can get free water all over the park from drinking fountains, but it‚Äôs warm. The trick? Ask food vendors for free ice, or use self-service ice machines at larger food courts. Bring your own bottle or cup and boom ‚Äî free iced water all day.\n\nFOOD & PAYMENT\nThey say no outside food or drinks, but no one checked. Having a few snacks and your own water bottle will save you time and money.\nAlso important: The park is fully cashless, so bring a credit or debit card ‚Äî no cash accepted anywhere\n\nWe had a great day, but I do think they oversell the Express pass a little. It‚Äôs still worth it for cutting down wait times, but manage your expectations ‚Äî and skip the Plus unless Minions are a must-do.\n\nPS : Waterworld show was still closed when we visited.",

I was really lucky because when I visited, Minion Land had just opened two days earlier.\n\nI was super impressed with Minion Land ‚Äî especially the 3D ride, which was so much fun! I also never get tired of the Transformers ride ‚Äî it‚Äôs still one of my favorites.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with my visit to Universal Studios Singapore and I‚Äôll definitely come back again",

            text: "Our family of four (two adults and two boys aged 4 and 10) recently enjoyed an absolutely unforgettable day at Universal Studios Singapore, all thanks to their VIP Experience. From the moment we arrived until the very end, it was stress-free, perfectly organized, and filled with magical moments.\n\nA huge thank you to our phenomenal guide, Dany, who made the day truly exceptional. Thoughtful, kind, and impeccably efficient, he ensured every detail was taken care of ‚Äî from fast-tracking our rides to helping us meet our favourite characters like Toothless, the Minions, Optimus Prime, and Bumblebee ‚Äî all without waiting in line. \n\nDany even had the foresight to make reservations for lunch for us at KT‚Äôs Grill, a calm oasis compared to the busy dining spots throughout the park on a rainy day.\n\nWhen heavy rain arrived, he had ponchos and umbrellas ready and flawlessly rearranged our itinerary, so we didn‚Äôt miss a single outdoor ride. Without being asked, Dany even extended our five-hour tour by an extra hour to make up for the weather ‚Äî a gesture that didn‚Äôt go unnoticed and was deeply appreciated.\n\nWhy We Recommend the VIP Experience:\n‚Ä¢\tPriority Access: Skip every queue, including those not covered by express passes ‚Äî even on peak the day we went which had 15,000 guests in the park.\n‚Ä¢\tDedicated Guide: Our guide handled everything ‚Äî customizing the day to our preferences and ensuring we got the most out of every moment.\n‚Ä¢\tComfort and Convenience: Access to a private lounge, reserved seating at shows, and unlimited express ride access after the tour.\n‚Ä¢\tExclusive Extras: Each VIP ticket included a $25 meal voucher, personalized touches (like our Minion-themed tickets), and exceptional service all day long.\n\nWhile the VIP Experience is a premium offering, it‚Äôs truly worth it ‚Äî especially for families. It transforms a day at the park from a tiring slog through queues into a joyful, stress-free adventure packed with moments you‚Äôll cherish.\n\nThanks again, Dany, for giving us one of the best theme park experiences we‚Äôve ever had. We‚Äôll never forget it.",

To put it bluntly it‚Äôs nothing more than an expensive backdrop full of Instagram hopefuls posing like fools and getting in the way. Average ride waiting time was 70 mins - ridiculous, especially in hot humid weather. Very little for young ones , could they not have put in a wait free splash pad?? Or something to occupy them while other kids wait 70 mins per ride . The place is small , filled with merchandise shops ( as expected) . Wait times on the app where incorrect and some wait time were over 120 mins per ride. It‚Äôs not a fun family day out- it‚Äôs frustrating & disappointing. I have been to Disney land in HK and it is far better run. We should have done the DUCK tour instead- oh well, live & learn. I actually feel like I was robbed it was that bad!",

NB All rides end in a gift shop, which will attract young kids to purchase an item. lol!  \nI recommend the express pass as an add on.  Some of the rides had a 70min wait, and with an express pass we didn‚Äôt wait any longer than 5-10mins on the busier rides.  I would have spend hours in total waiting or queuing if we didn‚Äôt have it.  A great day out overall.",

The park is well organized, with a great mix of thrilling rides, and immersive themed zones that bring your favorite movies to life.

            "text": "Universal knows how to make a theme park! When comparing to other amusement parks it's clear that a lot of effort has gone into making a day here a great experience. There are so many details that they have streamlined and considered that others miss. Like single-rider lanes for most attractions, always filling each ride, efficient loading/unloading for attractions, etc. We could ride SO much with single-rider, and very few seem to know about it or use it. Use it. Use it a lot!\n\nThe Studio Tour is the star of the show. It's amazing, don't miss it! It's also what separates Universal Studios Hollywood from the park in Orlando. \n\nThe themed lands are great, especially the Harry Potter land. It's amazing to just walk around in it. If you haven't experienced it before it's truly magical.\n\nCharacter meet & greets are very well organized. Characters show up on time on their designated spots and are all acting in character. The small interactions with each visitor is highly appreciated by our children.\n\nOn the downside the park feels a bit cramped. Super nintendo land for example feels like it should have a bigger space and the transformers metro base is just squeezed in without the opportunity for some more theming around it. It didn't help that big parts of the central area was under renovation during our visit. Universal Florida feels more open and as every attraction and land got the space it deserved.\n\nThe transition between upper and lower lot is tedious and easily becomes a bottle neck, even on a day with 20% attendance like when we visited.\n\nParking for $35 is really expensive though, and it doesn't matter if you just want to go to the city walk for a few hours or stay all day, the fee is the same.",

Expensive day out for a family of five and the shops are so over priced my son brought a dinosaur from the jurassic rebirth range 94 dollars only to find out in target exact same one is 43 dollars disgusting expect to pay more in the theme park but double come of it.",

            "text": "Awful, tacky, expensive, crowded place. My husband booked this as part of our California holiday. We‚Äôd been to see the sets at Warner Bros the day before, which was great. This is just hell on earth for me. I am 54, menopausal with arthritis in my neck. Couldn‚Äôt go on majority of rides. If he had told me this was mainly rides, I‚Äôd have had a day by the pool at our hotel. Boiling hot, crowded, people just walking into you. This place represents the worst of American excess. I‚Äôve loved the west coast but this is just hot and tacky and annoying. Avoid like hell if you do t like tides or crowds or you suffer from hot flushes!",

            "text": "We enjoyed the rides and atmosphere. Some pros/cons & tips:\n-the studio tour is great, about 45 min ride on a tram, plan this for when you feel like taking a break and sitting\n-lockers by the rides are free while you are on a ride.  We would have brought a backpack with snacks and water if we had known this. \n-get there early and go to your favorite rides first thing\n-Mario cart had a wait from 80 to 140 min all day, so we didn‚Äôt do it. The other rides were less than 80 at some point, and several were much shorter. \n-everyone seemed to get really wet on the Jurassic ride\n-most of the rides have a 3D motion part, so people who get seasick/dizzy easily might not like them\n-most food prices in the park didn‚Äôt seem excessive for the location\n-you can ask for a free cup of water at most food places without buying anything\n-there are water bottle fillers in the park\n-the staff were very friendly and helpful\n-if you get the app, you can check wait times and find attractions on the map",

            "text": "Entree is prijzig ($140 pp). Daarnaast proberen ze overal je geld afhandig te maken. Het is echt veel te commercieel geworden.  Bandjes voor Nintendo-land kosten nog eens $50 per bandje. Die heb je nodig voor Nintendo-land, anders mis je alles van dit gedeelte van het park. Het ziet er super-gaaf uit, maar of het dat geld waard is? Sommige ‚Äòshows‚Äô zijn ook om je geld afhandig te maken. Een show waarin je een toverstokje wordt aangemeten, is belabberd, en enkel bedoeld om je te verleiden om een dure Harry Potter stok te kopen. Verder overal duur en vet en ongezond eten. Het park was superdruk op de donderdag die wij er waren. Overal dikke rijen om 40 minuten tot wel soms wel bijna 2 uur wachten.  Jammer, wat het is echt een heel mooi park verder.",

            "text": "Universal Hollywood was just okay for us.  It was very expensive for not a lot of things to do-you really can do the entire park in less than one day, so the BOGO day free tickets are sort of pointless unless you live in Cali, and then most just have a season pass. We didn‚Äôt have terribly long lines, so that was great.  The whole upper and lower lots was a bit of a hassle with all the escalators and made the park hard to navigate.  We did have a medical issue and had to use first aid‚ÄîI would give them 10 stars for how well they handled the issue.  The rides are fun, but there aren‚Äôt enough little kid/non-rider friendly things to do for how much it costs.  I wouldn‚Äôt go back for how much it costs.  With that said, the park is extremely clean, and the themed areas are very well done.  Mario World and Harry Potter and Secret Life of Pets were family faves.  Transformers terrified my tween child and there wasn‚Äôt enough details or warning ahead of time (which resulted in the medical issue).  I wish we had done Disney instead.",

            "text": "Entrance price is similar to Disneyland, but you get a lot more at Disneyland. The best bit is the tour of the actual studio. I was a bit shocked at the sales tactics, an example is the wand shop. A very talented actor makes great play at choosing a wand for a bright eyed six year old, and hey presto he presents this wand (which after a great wait has chosen this one lad) magical........then the parents are invited to have a chat to a staff member where I suspect they are told the price.  At Disneyland photos taken of you on rides are free, here you are offered special deals. My last gripe is that they ask for photo ID, this meant having to bring our passports and I felt stressed at trying not to lose them. Once I entered Guest relations said that photos of our passports would have sufficed, if this is the case why not tell people? Anyway no one actually asked for a photo ID in the end, instead a fingerprint was taken. So why ask for a photo ID in the blurb? Otherwise the park offers great views and so far the rides are fun, ( we're half way through our day here).",

            "text": "We are not theme park people generally, but had an absolutely wonderful time at Universal Studios.  The park is smaller and more compact than Disney, and even on July 4th we didn't wait for more than 20 minutes for any ride (with standard admission - the express pass was too expensive).  We particularly liked Jurassic Park, The Mummy, and the two Harry Potter rides, and very much enjoyed the Water World show and of course the classic tram tour.",

            "text": "Der Eintritt kostet. Wir bezahlten pro Person 133 Euro. Aber daf√ºr wird sehr viel geboten. Die Unterhaltung ist bestens. Neben spektakul√§ren, themenbezogenen Rides (Fahrgesch√§ften) wie z.B. Mario Kart, The Secret Life of Pets, Harry Potter, Jurassic World, The Revenge of the Mummy ist auch die einst√ºndige, interessante Studiotour sehr zu empfehlen. Der Eintritt erm√§chtigt zum Besuch aller Attraktionen. Das Essen ist nicht inbegriffen. Es gibt auch innerhalb des kostenpflichtigen Gel√§ndes (nicht nur in der frei zug√§nglichen City ausserhalb) viele Essensm√∂glichkeiten. Im Sommer ist das Gel√§nde von 9 bis 21 Uhr offen. Es lohnt sich, gleich zur √ñffnung zu kommen. Am Morgen (und dann ab 17 Uhr wieder) sind die Wartezeiten k√ºrzer. Die l√§ngsten Wartezeiten gibt es bei Mario Kart. Das Express-Ticket, mit dem man die Wartezeiten vermeidet, ist doppelt so teuer und eigentlich nicht n√∂tig. Wir waren am Samstag nach 4th of July dort und warteten meist zwischen 10-20 Minuten. Oft wird auch w√§hrend der Wartezeit Unterhaltung geboten, wenn man z.B. durch verschiedene Vorr√§ume kommt.",

            "text": "Used the Buy 1, Get a Free 2nd Visit on the 4th of July and it was 100x better than the first visit in June. \n\nWe stayed about 15 minutes away near dodger stadium and drove in. Got to the parking around 8am and only waited 10 minutes to pay and park. Was at security by 8:30 and in the park right at 9. Busted down the doors and headed in.\n\nTips:\n\n1. Start at the Simpsons. There was no single rider last time so we started there to be sure. It was so good! Sign said 20 minutes but there was a 4 minute total wait. The ride was my 3rd favorite. \n\n2. Then head to Mummy Returns. We had no wait either. The BEST RIDE in the park as far as the action. #2 favorite ride. \n\n3. Grab a quick snack and get in line for Transformers. This was my #4 favorite ride. It opens at 10 so you‚Äôll get right on. It was OK. It is 3D and since I‚Äôm blink in one eye, the special effects didn‚Äôt work all that well for me. Still great though. \n\n4. Then head to Harry Potter. There are two rides. The outdoor rollercoaster might be the worst ride at the park. No single riders. Usually super long waits. And the ride lasts 2 minutes max. \n\nThe Harry Potter Forbidden Journey is the best ride in the park in my opinion. If you want to see all the cool things wait in the lines because the stuff in the lines is actually really cool. Once you‚Äôve done that, then do the single rider 10 more times. No wait to do that. \n\nThe lockers are free for I believe two hours right outside the ride since you can‚Äôt bring anything one.\n\nFinally we did the studio tour again. It was completely different this time and still super cool. Just because you‚Äôve done it once doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll see the same things.",

Of the 4 studios in Hollywood I would rate this4. I have done them all and Warner bros stands out as the best. The Jurassic park ride is excellent but you get very very wet. The mummy ride is completely in the dark and could be anything, poor. Didn‚Äôt do any other rides as they are for kids. The studio tour on golf type carts is excellent and you get to see the well documented jaws thing, crashed aircraft from war of the worlds etc look on utube cus it‚Äôs all old and on here. You learn nothing about how a studio works mainly because they don‚Äôt use back lots much anymore evidenced by none of the sets being dressed. Don‚Äôt buy front of line just go early and no queues at all",

            "text": "I first went here when I was 12. I'd been back to Universal Studio a bunch of times as an Actor and for Concerts but never felt the need to pay for the tour again. When my family wanted to go I decided I did need to go, specifically because I'm a Simpsons Fanatic and there's a good chance that someday they will tear-down Springfield to make room for another attraction. I was not disappointed. The tour was good, the Harry Potter stuff was cool enough and the Simpsons area was everything I had hoped. The simulator ride was fun and funny, Krusty Burger was a good a place to eat as anywhere in the park, where everything is expensive anyway, and DUFF BEER! Duff Beer Garden and a Moe's Tavern. The beer was on tap and pretty good. It's an American Lager, taste a bit like Budweiser, maybe a little better? One can get a bit of tunnel-vision looking at all the stuff going on, be sure and LOOK UP, there are Springfield Buildings and Characters above the main walkway that people were just walking by obliviously. The Simpsons souvenir shop really got me. I usually avoid those shops when I'm at any sort of Amusement Park, but for the Simpsons nerds, they have tons of cool stuff that you cant find anyplace else... and some stuff you might find elsewhere but will pay more for, especially considering you'd need to have it shipped to you.",

            "text": "Heel duur park, ook al ben je binnen moet je dingen bij kopen zoals een bandje voor Mario World anders mag je niet in de attracties? Het stopwoord is 10 dollar, drinken kost gemiddeld 10 dollar, magneten 10 dollar en ga zo maar door. Het parkeren is na het betalen van een pittige entreeprijs met 35 dollar  eigenlijk crimineel. De hele manier van binnengaan bij Waterworld leek op een soort van ongeorganiseerde vee drijven. Wij waren het er over eens dat de backlot tour het leukste is en het best gelukt. Volgende keer maar naar Moviepark Germany dat heeft meer sfeer en is dichterbij! ",

            "text": "Il biglietto non √® certamente economico se si va in famiglia. Noi eravamo in coppia e se potessimo ci torneremmo domani. Bello il tour degli studios (disponibile in inglese e spagnolo), stupenda l‚Äôarea a tema Harry Potter. Consiglio di arrivare al mattino ad orario di apertura e di fare immediatamente la fila per le attrazioni pi√π gettonate, Harry Potter e Super Nintendo World. Non sapevamo bene cosa aspettarci dalle attrazioni, sono pi√π o meno tutte simili ma la prima (per noi Harry Potter) √® stata davvero pazzesca e super inaspettata. Per noi, una delle tappe imperdibili a Los Angeles. I prezzi all‚Äôinterno del parco per i viveri sono decisamente proibitivi, come qualunque altro parco simile",

Staff very helpful for a traveller with mobility issues and on occasion let us use express lanes without an express ticket to avoid the long queues. Not a big one for thrill rides but still plenty to see and do. The Waterworld Show was awesome - highly recommend. Harry Potter theming was amazing. The free hotel shuttle was definitely worth using rather than walking up/down a decent sized hill.",

Rides and interactive experiences are amazing.  Buy a wand and bring it with you each time you come.  We‚Äôre coming back this May and will try out the FanFest night event.  Also like their  VIP tours.  You don‚Äôt need 10 to 12 people in your own group to take advantage of the special treatment.  Love the tram ride no matter how many times we go on it.  They try to keep it as up-to-date as possible.  City Walk right next to it has a lot to see and do as well.",

            "text": "f your intention of visiting Universal Studios is to mainly go on the Studio Tour well at the moment I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money ,it took barely 30 minutes today most areas were off limits due to filming ,not movies but streaming tv shows.‚Ä®The attractions on the tour are so poor the King Kong 3D experience was not working properly as it was stationary throughout.\nAlso the colours seem very faded and can‚Äôt believe the many years this has been an attraction nearly 15 years and I am sure technology has moved on and Jackson hasn‚Äôt done much since apart from jumping on The Beatles bandwagon!\nAnd the 3D glasses are either that old they don‚Äôt work anymore as with or without didn‚Äôt notice any difference.‚Ä®\nNope is not worth mentioning as it‚Äôs totally pathetic only fun is watching the blank expressions on people‚Äôs faces and such a poor end to the tour now that The Fast and Furious attraction that used to be at the end of the tour is now closed which is a shame as I used to enjoy that.\nDisappointing that it seems the only way you can go to areas like Court House Square now is on FanFest nights for an extra $74\n‚Ä®Warner Brothers tour is much better and you see real sets ,not just told what was in sound stages-hilarious!",

            "text": "We loved the park and rides, truly enjoyed those. However, we were disappointed to see characters attitude towards kids. Scooby, Shrek and Fiona - I assume you are there to interact with kids, not ignore and walk away from them (especially when they run towards you and stop waiting for your reaction, while you simply walk by). Scooby run to a disabled child (ignoring everyone on the way) and stayed with them for ages. Understood, but you need to think that not all disabilities are immediately visible and you actually made an autistic child wonder why he was totally ignored and so small in your eyes! Even if you are busy, it‚Äôs not difficult to wave or high-five them if you do need to be elsewhere! Human touch was missing, while we liked the facilities and surely preferred it over Disneyland Paris which is always so crowded!",

            "text": "I have not been to Universal in 30 years. I got a gold pass for myself and the Costco annual passes for my husband and two kids. We live in Southern California and this was a year of fun versus one day at Disneyland. We just had our first visit. I wanted to write a review about the things I look for in reviews. I always want to know where I can refill my water. Water fountains in park only. The only water bottle filling station I saw was in the locker storage room in the City Walk area outside the park. Nice setup with bathrooms and water bottle filling station and lockers. We paid $12 for the day to store our lunch cooler and jackets. We decided next time we will just leave it in the car because it is not too much farther from City Walk. We also bought the freestyle cup and just refilled it all day and got water that way when we needed. Great way to have drinks on hand all day.\nLastly, about the backpacks. The Harry Potter ride for example does not allow backpacks because the restraint comes down and there is no place for the bag on your back. They offer small free lockers while you ride the ride but if you have a backpack like us you have to pay the $5 to store it that you don't get back. Bummer. Next time we will bring fanny packs only which were okay and stick our Freestyle drink cup in the free locker while we ride. Food was reasonable. Not any worse than fast food prices for our family of four these days. Especially with the gold pass discount. Next time we plan to stick some pretzels and snacks in our fanny packs and eat in the park and have some food in the car in case we want some more options from home. It was a great fun day. We are glad we have passes because it was a lot to do in one day!",
