If you don‚Äôt have much time, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend stopping by the Minions since it‚Äôs not as good as the others. Overall, we really liked it and had a lot of fun.

Told come back on 1 hr and would get us on, when we returned the person was not there. Spent all day there and got on 3 rides. \n2nd visit had done express passes, another waste of money, queue nearly as long but did get on a few more rides. \n3rd visit went to epic, another waste of time , upon entry informed queue for Harry Potter ride was 6hours, didn‚Äôt want to spend all day queuing do went to circus, again 1.5hr wait to be told it was cancelled. Spent the day just looking around. In total got on about 10 rides over 3days, so about ¬£45 per ride. Won‚Äôt return here again. \nThe other parks better value for money.",

            text: "We visited three Universal Parks in August 2025: Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and the newly-opened Epic. Whilst most of the rides in all parks were fun and engaging, the overall theme coming from the experience is that some guests (wealthier) are more important than others! \n\nLet‚Äôs start with Express Passes. For a family of four that had already spent an arm and a leg getting to and staying in Orlando and then more to get into the parks, I was constantly being upsold the Express Tickets. For an extra $1200 per day, I, with my family of four, could skip any queue as many times as we liked. Morally, I just won‚Äôt go there and do that. I like to teach my children patience and fairness. However, others (with more money than me) had no issue with this and whilst you wait in very long lines with the other morally superior people (but more financially challenged) you watch endless streams of Express-Pass holders file past you and get on rides at a ratio (and I quote one of the miserable staff members now) of 3:1. That‚Äôs right. For every ride, they let Express-Pass holders ride at 3 to 1 in Express-Pass holders‚Äô favours. Yes, I‚Äôm bitter that they have more money than me for such things, sure, but where it really affects us common people is that it ups your wait times considerably. One of the Harry Potter rides had a wait time of 25 mins so we joined the queue. Within a few minutes of this, Universal had shut down all of the external coasters due to adverse weather. That meant that within 10 mins of our 25 min wait, the Express lanes had filled considerably, turning our 25 min wait into an hour and a half as the Express holders were constantly favoured over us plebs time and time again. It just leaves you with such a sour feeling of second-rate citizenship and that as a guest, you just aren‚Äôt important and it‚Äôs about nothing more than greed. \n\nRight. Back to miserable staff members: these people have no idea of how to speak to or treat people. Lost? Need directions? Ask a member of staff, right? Nope! Wrong! They just shrug their shoulders or plain ignore you. Want to buy something in a. gift shop? Most (not completely all of them in this case) treat you with apathy and barely make eye contact. Want to know info about a ride at the entrance to a queue? Well, have the decency to at least wait until the two staff members stationed there have finished their private conversations before having the audacity to actually talk to them! In all, the staff were mostly (with a few notable exceptions) miserable, misanthropic and clearly hated their jobs. I actually started challenging some of them as to why they were so rude to me for no reason? They just turned their backs most of the time. Appalling behaviour for those in the service industry. Worth pointing out that I‚Äôm a relatively easy-going, relaxed and polite person and not what you‚Äôd consider difficult or awkward. \n\nLet‚Äôs talk about the locker system. It‚Äôs rubbish and completely flawed! Lockers are located outside rides and are slightly bigger than the hole for a UK letterbox. They‚Äôre tiny. Some rides have metal detectors that mean that you have to leave everything in a locker: phone, wallet, hats, drinks, glasses‚Ä¶ rucksacks! Yup, your rucksacks, full of water and no doubt food to avoid those $12-20 snacks have to go into the teeny-tiny lockers. We needed three as a family of four and more often than not, there weren‚Äôt actually any lockers free. But hold on, there are bigger lockers available‚Ä¶ at a price of $3 plus extra if you exceed a certain time. Another greedy ripoff. Some rides don‚Äôt have metal detectors so you can keep your wallet and phone at least which allows you to plan your next queueing adventure once you‚Äôve done your two hours of watching Express-Pass holders get one over on you (I‚Äôm still bitter about that!) but they don‚Äôt tell you which so you‚Äôre left to guess. It‚Äôs such a stupid and ridiculous system. It‚Äôs downright dangerous sometimes trying to get a locker as the cramped spaces are full with people pushing and shoving and others trying to put things in or take things out of lockers right above your head. The cr√®me-de-la-cr√®me of this system, however, has to be that in order to open your locker, you need your ticket. The same ticket that you likely keep in your wallet or on the phone that you have to stare. Such a clever, well-thought out plan Universal. Paper ticket in my pocket then - a ticket that needs to make it through two weeks of parks and coasters and queues etc in sweltering heat‚Ä¶\n\nThe final icing on the cake for me was buying a refillable cup at Toad‚Äôs Cafe in Mario World on our first day. I asked the explicit question: Is it refillable in all parks? The answer: yes! Is it valid for all days? The answer: yes! Whoopee! $40 well spent on a cool cup for my children that was also refillable making it actually worth it. Until you get to another park on another day only to find the real answer to the questions: Is it refillable? Yes, but only on the day that you purchase it! Can I pay to recharge it like the other refillable cups? No. We don‚Äôt sell those cups in the other parks so we can‚Äôt do anything about it. Hmm, pretty sure I‚Äôve seen them for sale in these other parks! No you haven‚Äôt, sir! Oh, sorry. Of course, I forgot I‚Äôm a compulsive liar. (I did get somewhat perturbed at customer services at this point!) But there you have it - Universal‚Äôs non-award winning approach to a customer-led experience. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. \n\nMy feedback to Universal is to send some execs into their own parks as a standard customer (no Express Passes) and then send them to the Disney parks. Who does it better? Disney, by such a huge margin. The organisation, the timings, the general ‚Äòcan do and nothing is too much trouble‚Äô attitude of the cast members there is something that Universal really need to take note of. No matter how good your rides are, people still want to feel validated and acknowledged as welcomed visitors to your parks.",

We were guided all the way through the castle and queues to the gift shop! Turns out the rides broke and nobody bothered to tell us. \nWe headed to Jurassic park the kids wanted to ride Pterandodon Flyers 15 min queue time quickly turned into 60 minute.\nWe then headed to Reign of Kong, queued for an hour and it broke down whilst we were riding and had to be evacuated. We got one ride complimentary fast pass. \nHeaded to Dudley do rights ripsaw falls that was broke down. We did ride the rapids though and that was fun! Went for lunch paid $70 for three meals and an incredibly rude cashier who stopped me mid order to have a 5 minute conversation with someone else.\nHeaded over to Hollywood studios went on minions with the fast pass, we still queued for 30 mins and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. \nWent on villain con that broke too. \nFinished in Simpsons land it was ok. \nChose to spend our last day at Epic Universe, what a mistake! \nNintendo land looks amazing but was crazy busy. The rollercoast was broken down and the two rides had wait times of 80 and 245mins. We had a fast pass for our nephew they told us to come back at 3pm, we couldn‚Äôt use the pass for anything else in the mean time and it only halved the wait time.\nWe headed over to Isle of Berk three rides again, wait times of over 180 minutes for the three rides. We booked the roller coaster and headed to Ministry of Magic. The ride wait time was 210 minutes, not happening with young children. \nWe had lunch and went back to our booked time-slot for the rollercoaster at Isle of Berk. After a 30 minute conversation queue the ride broke down and we had to leave. At this point we headed to guest services to lodge a complaint and were placed in a huge queue of people. We gave up and headed home.\nUniversal studios could be great but long queues, rides not working rude staff and generally run down and tatty park areas left me unimpressed.\nEpic Universe - I feel I have been robbed. The price of the ticket that I only have one day to use and the long wait times mean it‚Äôs impossible to do it all if any. Universal put you in a position where you have to pick maybe 2/3 decent rides because the queues are so long or pay them even more money for a fast pass which isn‚Äôt really that fast. To expect people to wait over three hours for rides is crazy and quite frankly wrong especially with younger children. \nThe price I paid for the tickets and the experience didn‚Äôt match up at all and I left thinking ‚Äòwow I could have gone on a weekend European break for the price of that.‚Äô\nHopefully others go more prepared and they have a better experience than we did.",

If you are a HP fan the park is worth it for this area. Otherwise, the park is sooooo outdated. Men in Black, Simpson‚Äôs (so jerky), Jimmy Fallon, Fast & Furious, and Minions, all need to be REPLACED! Even though ET is also outdated- at least it was a cute, fun ride. Lunch at Finnegan‚Äôs was average- definitely need more restaurants. The parade was lacking, and also outdated. Overall, for the price, this park was very disappointing.",

We left at 2pm and took Hogwarts express to Islands of adventure.\n\nThe highlight for my 18yr old daughter was the Rip ride rocket, mine was the parade and being asked to dancer by one of the salsa dancers in one of the pop up shows.

As soon as the show started though they were gobsmacked, as was I, as nothing can prepare you for this and HIGHLY recommend getting there early to get a spot.\n\nOn the more low key things to do, the Monstors Make up show can be a tad ‚Äúdad humour‚Äù, but kids will love it.\n\nMinions stuff is also good.\n\nTheir evening show though is arguably better than anything Disney put on, especially when we went our second time and they had the accompanying drones for extra effect.\n\nAll in all, some of our best days were at Universal and we will probably be back here more often than Disney when we return to Orlando one day in the future.",

            text: "This was my first time visiting Universal Studios since I was a kid. Our hotel offered a shuttle bus to the park, which was super convenient. No parking stress to deal with. Once we got dropped off, we went through a quick security check, then headed to the main gate to scan our tickets. This was also my first time buying the Express Pass. I got to ride every major ride the park has to offer. I skipped the kid section since that‚Äôs just not my thing. The Harry Potter area threw me off at first. It‚Äôs kind of hidden behind a brick wall, and we actually walked past it and had to walk back. But once we found it, we rode the rides and tried the famous Butterbeer. To be honest, it tasted like cream soda with whipped cream on top. Overall, the park is definitely more for families and people who prefer mild rides. I‚Äôm more into thrillers and intense coasters, so for me, it was just okay.",

Day pass alone is more expensive than Disney and then to enhance experience was told to add express pass at the overinflated price of 299 per person. Absolutely not worth.  Express pass lane still took on average 30-40 minutes to go through.  Stairs up the wazoo and number of total number of available rides less than 10. Way better off at Disney.   Even one of the cast members said express pass is not worth it especially since it excludes the 3 most popular rides anyway.  Also food line was over an hour to get worst tasting burger ever.",

Waited for an hour in the queue to get the assistance pass, to be told i wasnt eligible under the parks regulations!! I have CFS/ME & osteoarthritis in both knees,  was in a wheelchair to cope with the park.  My son is type 1 diabetic & unable to withstand long queues as danger of low blood sugars in the heat.  I also had my elderly father with me. Thankfully,  after MUCH discussion with a member of staff,  we got a limited assistance pass. But in total wasted 1 hour & 43 mins at the park! \nThis could have been avoided had I been contacted prior to the visit.  \nI felt like this was a waste of money! (Not a problem at SeaWorld,  they were happy to help us!)\n Considering the high cost for tickets & $60 for parking  you'd think the least they could do would be to help those in need!

            text: "I would give 0 star for customer service from a food stand.\nAll other park experience is 4 stars.(the reason not making it to 5 stars as there were so crowed, long wait on many popular item. )\n\nOur family of 4 visited one of your food stands on our second day in Universal Studio.\nMy son enjoyed the refillable cup on the first day so he wants it again on the second day.\nNot until we just paid full price of $18.99(with tax $20.22) and were waiting for your staff to hand over the cup and receipt. My husband asked if there would be a better price if we already have a cup from the first day?  And your staff confirmed that ‚Äúwe only need to pay $12/ before tax. Thus we asked to adjust the payment right away ( either refund the first full price payment and charge $12 or adjust the original payment to $12).\nHe said he couldn‚Äôt do it , he had to wait for the manager for authorization and he indicated that he texted his manager. So we were waiting and waiting on the stand on this hot and humid day‚Ä¶. We have been very patient but up to a point we feel no one cares about us or does anything.\nI asked Ricky, is your manager coming ? He said he had no response from the manager , not only that , he was never trying to resolve the problem while we were waiting for long. So 30 mins past , I checked again and nothing happened and not even with any progress, I told Ricky , I want the receipt that I paid for full price . We are really not paying hundreds to waste our time here. I will file a claim later.  Even though I said so, he still kept me waiting for another 10+ mins ( even other customers reached out to me and wanted to know what happened as they noticed us standing there for a long time ). So at the end of the day , we still paid full price, not the $12 that we are qualified for. And we waited for over 40 mins  suffering from the heat for NOTHING!\n\nHere are issues for your attention:\n\n1. Staff Ricky didn't make efforts to help but only asked us to wait forever.\n\n2. Any shop should be able to reverse the transaction and why this specific staff, Ricky, cannot do it - either do refund or adjust the payment.( It is always possible that your staff may make a mistake on charging customers or customers make a mistake on their order,as well. Shouldn‚Äôt staff be capable of managing the change /correction ?\n\n3. If only the manager can do such a payment adjustment or refund, why did it take such a long time for the customer, especially during peak season in summer ?( we waited for over 40 mins but nothing happened, so I doubt how much longer it would take to get a manager's response and even if the manager would come to help ? ) it is too ridiculous for Universal Studio as such a high end and pricey theme park to provide this poor service.\n\n4. If a customer can use an existing cup( which is great for the environment too ) to get a better price of $12, why not let the customer know at the first place so that we don‚Äôt have to suffer the price adjustment processes in our case.(not until we asked or we will never know this deal)\n\nSome customers who saw us waiting for a long time highly recommended that we should  reach out to you guys to explain the whole thing , as it was so wrong!They would be frustrated like we do.\n\nI am sharing my experience here, as I hope other travelers would not waste their time waiting for something like this as you will have to spend tons of time on waiting for rides .(If I knew it took so much time, I shouldn't trust your staff and wait there.)\n\nI am attaching the food stand, our receipt, the staff name and coupon for your reference.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon!\nThanks!\n\nSincerely,\nLing",

            text: "Epic Adventure = Epic Failure      Spent $1924. on tickets for family of 5.  This was one day Epic and one day park to park.   After standing for 90 minutes to get on a five minute long ride we walked back to purchase a fast pass for Epic; only to find they were sold out for the day.    We purchased fast passes for the next day (park/park) for a total of $1571.   Adding this balance to our original tickets we now have spent $3495. for tickets for a family of 5.  (approx $700 per person for 2 days; one without fast pass)\n\nIn my opinion, Epic Adventure is not fully developed.   The Disney/Universal experience is not there yet.    Rides are limited thus lines can be over 90 to 120 minutes of wait time; often in full sun.   Sit down restaurants few and far between.   There is a Starbucks.  I noted while walking through a tunnel numerous family groups sitting on the ground resting against the sides of the tunnel just to sit and find relief from sun.   I went to an ice cream stand and there were three small tables only 2 with umbrellas.   We invited others to sit with us as there was nowhere for people to take a break in the shade.   I spoke with two park employees who said more things would be happening in the future; I think Universal should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a poor experience.   People where actually lying in landscaped areas just to find relief.  This is July in Florida, and as a resident I believe I am more acclimated to the heat; and felt very sorry for those people with young children in carriages, as well as the elderly.  Unlike the other parks I did not see any characters for picture taking or interaction.  The rides appeared to be more roller coaster types (think amusement park, which you can get anywhere).  Due to the long wait times I believe we only went on 4/5 rides.  You do the math for the cost per person per ride.  I asked my grandchildren ages 10 and 12 (full adult ticket purchases) which they enjoyed more, Hersey Park in PA or Epic Adventure.  They chose Hershey, followed by Busch Gardens, Williamsburg Va or Dollywood.  \n\nThe second day we went to combo Universal Studies and Universal Island of Adventure.      All around it was a wonderful experience and I wish we could have gotten to many more rides.  There are numerous indoor dining venues, as well as stands that sell a variety of food items, such as fresh watermelon.  Shade is everywhere.  Character interaction is numerous; the afternoon parade was great!  Musical performances (like Stomp) are ongoing.  I can't say enough about how great these two parks are.\n\nUnfortunately my son had a medical emergency and was transported by ambulance to a local hospital.   I have to commend all staff at first aid for their expedious triage and care.   Truly first rate.   \n\nDue to the emergency we would not continue to enjoy the great experience we were having, but we did get numerous rides in and staff was outstanding.\n\nIf I returned, I would go only to the Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.   Get the fast pass it is worth it.    Skip Epic for a while until it is fully built out.  What you save by skipping Epic Universe will pay for your fast pass for the other two parks.",

A lot of the rides are indoors.  Don't miss the Harry Potter area of the park and if you have park to park tickets take the train.  It is a very unique train.  There was a parade around 2 or 3 that we didn't expect but was a lot of fun.  Take in a Stanley Cup or some type of cup with water.  It's allowed and you can refill it with water.   It is hot.

I say pretend because you cannot use the dining dollars at Universal Studios.

            text: "Universal Studios Japan is a very fun place but can be a bit hectic as well. If you plan it right you can enjoy it. First of all buy your tickets from Klook. I actually wasn't able to buy the tickets from the official website. I read that that happens a lot to people from outside of Japan. The days are color coded according to how busy they are expected to be and the prices differ as well. Try to opt for a day that isn't too crowded. We chose the middle out of 5 levels and it was overall ok, even though it was a Saturday. I would also highly recommend a fast pass package. There are many options and it can be confusing so some research to determine which rides you want to go on and which areas you want to access is unfortunately essential. The fast pass gives you timed access to some areas like Super Nintendo World and Harry Potter, which are the two most crowded as well as access to the fast track line for one of the rides in those areas and other rides as well. An important tip is that the park opens about an hour before the stated time for that day. So people actually show up 2 hours before the official opening time to get a good spot in the queue and when they do open they rush usually to Super Nintendo World. You don't need a timed access before the park \"officially\" opens. You could also rush to an area where you don't have a later timed entry already. Alternatively you can check the app and book a timed entry or find staff who hand out timed entry tickets. Both of those have to be done in the park on the day of your visit. I personally opted for a timed entry to Super Nintendo World and a fast pass for Mario Kart and another for Harry Potter and one of the roller coasters as well as the Jaws ride and another roller coaster. There are many options on Klook but take care that they sell out very early. So buy them in advance. The rides are all fun and there are a lot of shows as well. There are plenty of food options too. I had a pizza near the Jaws ride and a nice strawberry dessert from a Super Mario themed cafe. My favorite area was Super Nintendo World. The Donkey Kong ride was a very long wait, but worth it in my opinion. Try to get a fast pass for that if you book early enough. Overall a busy but enjoyable day.",

            text: "Please, please, please. Book a week to a month before your planned visit because passes WILL run out. I forgot about that and booked a day before so we were left with the regular passes. I had a 3 and a 6yr old with me so the 3yr old came in for free. Also, book on Klook.. they might offer the passes a bit cheaper compared to the website. And they have packages as well.. like the one with the \"Have fun in Kansai\" pass which let's you ride the train from Kansai airport for free.\nStudy the passes and their packages and see what suits you.. might be Nintendo world, Harry potter or Donkey Kong.\nDownload the app! But you won't be able to use it unless you're inside USJ. We, who only had the regular passes had to hustle inside and use the app immediately so that we could pick a time for Nintendo world. Yes, there will be time slots available but it WILL run out fast. So, pick the earliest time available and book it right away. \nPackages with specific fast passes to rides is essential especially if you enjoy rides. Average wait times will be 30-45 mins, or can even go up to an hour. So pick your rides. I went to the flying dinosaur and waited about 30mins. Fast pass cuts that time by 80% so I saw people pass me by and just skipped the line.\nFun rides for adrenaline rushers will be Flying Dinosaur,  Hollywood dream and Hollywood backdrop. Mid-rides will be DKs country, Mario kart, Harry potter etc.\nTip: Elmo's ride sits only toddlers up to kindergarten age. So if your kid is a first grader just say he's still in kindergarten.

The wait times were honestly a joke, far too long and by the time we arrived, every single fast track option had already sold out. To make the most of our time, we ended up using the single rider lines for basically every ride, which worked well for efficiency but meant we never actually got to ride on one or two things together.\n\nThat being said, Super Nintendo World was absolutely incredible, easily the highlight of the park and an experience I‚Äôll never forget. The theming, atmosphere, and overall design were truly amazing.\n\nOverall, though, the park was just far too crowded, and the lack of fast track availability really hurt the experience. If you‚Äôre planning a visit, buy fast tracks in advance as they‚Äôre always sold out on the day. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt go back, but if you‚Äôre in Osaka it‚Äôs definitely worth visiting at least once, especially for Nintendo fans.",

I will start with positives, the Jurassic park, harry Potter and donkey Kong rides were memorable. The water world show as also very well done. I couldn't help thinking though that they don't really care about there patrons. The lack of shade and seating in hot weather is borderline inhumane and I personally found it a disgrace. I sat and watched people queued up in express lanes they had paid massive money for (much like us) in the hot sun with nothing around to make them comfortable. Also some of the locker setups are a joke with people cramming into to tight spaces to secure their stuff. If I were overseeing a place like this I would do the following. Make patrons as comfortable as possible at the security and entry points. Fans, water mist, shaded cover and obvious line markings so people don't push in. Put seats around the whole park on the edge of every garden bed. Put rows of vending machines everywhere. The ease of getting things and moving will speed up everything and have a knock on effect. And lastly, get Gordon Ramsay in there quick sticks! The food is absolute rubbish and extortionate prices. All in all, if those few rides were rubbish this would have been a complete crash and burn. We spent the best part of $2500 aud for one day with 4 people, lunch and waters all day. A couple of souvenirs. I don't think we went silly with spending but wow what a joke.",

The design of the area was just incredible and the rides were fun.\n\nMy tip is to do single rider on any ride you don't mind going on together, it can make such a difference to the wait time. Then you have extra time to queue for the ones that you do.\n\nThe park has been very cleverly designed and even getting here was simple- the line from central Osaka was fast and inexpensive.",

After queuing to get in (be sure to take sun umbrellas and plenty of water in summer as you will spend much time queuing in direct sunlight) a fast-paced walk/jog directly to Nintendo World paid off as we were able to get entry to that section of the park without queuing, be sure to get there first thing if you want to achieve the same.. sadly this is where things go down hill.. we only aimed to get on one ride in this area.. ‚ÄòMinecraft madness‚Äô.. sadly the queuing time was just over 3 hours!! (after initial signs stating 2 hours) Had it not been summer we probably would have stuck it out.. but.. despite the considerable effort of Universal Studios to keep the place cool the summer weather was just too much unless you have at least 3 litres of water per person whilst queuing for the ride + previously mentioned sun umbrella(s).. we waited an hour and gave up.. much to my sons dismay.. it just wasn‚Äôt worth the potential heat-related health problems (and we‚Äôre not unfit/overweight etc).\n\nWe went on to discover that all the proper rides had similar wait times.. in the end we watched the ‚ÄòSing‚Äô show which was about 20mins of furry animal costumes mostly lip syncing.. fun but not talented.  \n\nOne very positive thing I have to say is that all the park staff are very friendly and helpful so that was really great :)\n\nUnfortunately the food options are not good.  Unless you really want to spend more than most families would consider reasonable (even expected) for a theme park or get anything like ‚Äòproper‚Äô food.. just take your own.. you‚Äôll be very glad you did.  Drinks are available all over which is great but food is very sparse and poor and very overpriced.\n\nAlthough we were able to get some good photos from around the park and enjoyed checking out the shops (again the usual theme park premium applies) we sadly came away having gone on zero rides due to the excessive wait times (although this would have been less of a problem if the temperature was sub 30 degrees), this is obviously caused by the park allowing way, WAY more people than the park can reasonably accommodate.. we left feeling very much like we‚Äôd been sold an experience that would never have been possible to deliver due to visitor numbers.. if you do go and you have the money.. definitely spend the extra on premium passes to avoid disappointment..",

The long queues for some of the rides was too much of a hassle due to humidity, so we skipped them. I am sure we wouldn't have covered Super Nintendo World. If we had visited during cooler months, I am sure my family & I would stay until the closing time. Multiple kiosks selling ice creams & cold juices is a big relief. We enjoyed the Harry Potter rides. But the merch isn't original, so we did not buy anything. Thankfully we had visited \"The Making of Harry Potter\" in Tokyo a week prior.",

            text: "Este parque solamente merece la pena visitarlo si te gusta Harry Potter y Super Nintendo World. De lo contrario mejor ah√≥rrate la entrada, tu tiempo y tu dinero.\nEl parque no es muy grande y lo m√°s alucinante que vimos fue lo masificado que est√° y la gran cantidad de colas que hay para todas las atracciones, habiendo algunas de hasta 2 horas. Hasta para comer e ir al ba√±o hay colas... Con respecto a las atracciones de Harry Potter y Super Nintendo World, destacar est√°n recreadas de forma incre√≠ble y, pese a que se tenga el pase expr√©s, habr√° que esperar como m√≠nimo 15 minutos de cola. Recomiendo comprar dicho pase a Super Nintendo si no quieres quedarte sin visitarlo, ya que hay mucha gente que quiere verlo. De verdad, ahorraros madrugar mucho para pasar gratis como lo venden muchos influencers puesto que es muy complicado. Por otro lado, no entiendo que haya tantos decorados americanizados en este parque, para m√≠ est√°n de m√°s y no proceden. Tampoco entiendo que en plena √©poca de verano haciendo un calor y humedad horrible no haya apenas sombras en el parque y no se pongan unos simples toldos. Tambi√©n los precios de los souvenirs y de la comida son bastante caros. Nada entendible que en sitios como Don Quijote tengas lo mismo a mitad de precio y con tax free.\nLo recomiendo solo y s√≠ aceptas lo que he comentado previamente. Es posiblemente una de los mejores planes que se pueden hacer en Osaka. Est√° demasiado sobrevalorado para lo que es, no volver√≠a si volviera a visitar Jap√≥n.",

            text: "We tried booking via the Japan site over a period of 4 weeks.  Everytime we'd get to the final stage of payment and their site wouldn't accept our credit cards.  We tried Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Wise from multiple countries.  We even emailed them step by step screen shots of the issues (along with 1000's of other redditers having the same issues) and they point blankly told us there was nothing wrong with their site.  We eventually bough tickets on the English version of the site and they accepted our CC first time with no issues. Minus points to Universal Studios for their arrogance and ignorance.\n\nWe arrived about 40 minutes early to a queue of about 1,000 people waiting to go inside.  It was already hot at 8am and it took a good 40 to 60 minutes to get inside.  Once inside we had a Express 4 Pass that we used (It saved a lot of time in the queues and got us onto the Mine Cart ride after it had closed to the general public).  That said they are pretty expensive.\n\nWe ended up doing Super Nintendo World (2 hours), Harry Potter (1.5 hours),  Minions (new ride - Villain Con Minion Blast - really cool except you're standing all the time - even on the ride, but it's a lot of fun) (1 hour), Jaws (30 mins), and two of the roller coasters (both good fun).  We did one of the 4D shows, but it's all in Japanese and we struggled to understand what was going on (before going in, everything is subtitled in English, but once inside the English disappears). The rest of the time was finding food, goods, walking between areas - it's deceptively larger than it looks.  We left at closing and only got home by 10:30pm..  A long but enjoyable day..\n\nDownside : We tried one ride where we asked if our son (neurodiverse) could wait in another area while we waited in a queue.  They struggled to understand English and using a translator device finally understood what we wanted.  They took my wife and son to a room (that they absolutely hated) and myself and my other son stood in the queue.  Everytime we asked when they would join us, no one understood or knew what to do.  We eventually had to go fetch them and we called it a \"lets never try that again\" event.",

            text: "I came to Universal Studios Japan (USJ) with my family hoping for a fun, magical day together‚Äîbut we left feeling exhausted, frustrated, and honestly, exploited.\n\nI've been to Disneyland and other major parks before, but what I experienced at USJ was something else entirely: a park that feels **intentionally designed to squeeze every yen out of you**, regardless of how it impacts the guest experience‚Äîespecially for families with kids.\n\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of what felt greedy and disappointing:\n\n---\n\n### üéüÔ∏è 1. **Massive Overcrowding**\n\nThe park was **packed beyond capacity**, with 2+ hour lines for most rides and very little space to rest or enjoy the atmosphere. It‚Äôs clear that USJ doesn‚Äôt meaningfully cap attendance‚Äîeven on peak days. It felt more like a money grab than a curated experience.\n\n---\n\n### üí∏ 2. **Paywalls Inside the Park**\n\n* Want to skip the insane lines? You *have* to pay extra for an **Express Pass**, which costs more than the ticket itself in many cases.\n* Want to actually participate in Super Nintendo World or Harry Potter World? Get ready to buy expensive **Power-Up Bands (¬•4,200)** or **Interactive Wands (¬•5,000‚Äì6,000)**.\n* These aren't just souvenirs‚Äîthey're **required tools** for core features. You can't really interact without them.\n\n---\n\n### üç± 3. **No Outside Food or Drinks Allowed**\n\nUSJ **bans all outside food**, including snacks and bento for children. This forces guests to buy overpriced food inside the park. Even soft drinks from outside aren‚Äôt allowed. Contrast that with Tokyo Disneyland, which allows food and even has designated picnic areas.\n\n---\n\n### üßí 4. **Not Family-Friendly**\n\nAs a parent, I was shocked at how little consideration is given to families:\n\n* No flexibility on ride access for kids,\n* Few quiet or shaded areas to rest,\n* Long waits with no real accommodations for children.\n\nIt feels like the park is **designed for spending**, not comfort or enjoyment‚Äîespecially for families.\n\n---\n\n### üì± 5. **App Dependency and Poor Transparency**\n\nAccess to popular areas like Super Nintendo World or Harry Potter World often requires a **timed-entry ticket via the USJ app**. These run out early in the morning and aren't well communicated. If you‚Äôre not super tech-savvy or fluent in Japanese, you‚Äôre out of luck.\n\n---\n\n### üßæ Summary:\n\n**Universal Studios Japan feels like it‚Äôs built to extract money at every step**: overpriced food, required upsells, no crowd control, and zero flexibility or family-friendliness. Compared to Disneyland (which we loved), this was a stressful and joyless experience.\n\nI won‚Äôt be returning, and I can‚Äôt recommend this park to families or visitors who value fairness, transparency, or actual fun.",

            text: "El parque est√° muy bien ambientado pero las atracciones son bastante normales, con alguna excepci√≥n. Colas largu√≠simas en todas partes, los pases express van con hora fija por atracci√≥n y no hay forma de que se pueda acceder antes, lo cual es bastante desventajoso porque los horarios que te asignan no facilitan la visita, puede haber mucho tiempo entre una y otra y alguna tienes que esperar casi a que cierren el parque. El √°rea Nintendo muy bonita, pero tiene poca cosa, la atracci√≥n de Yoshi es como un tren para ni√±os peque√±os, en la de Donkey Kong 3 horas de cola todo el d√≠a. \n\nEn muchas partes no hay ni un sitio para sentarse.\n\nCompr√© el pase express porque en muchos blogs y rese√±as pon√≠a que era una forma de garantizar entrar a Nintendo world, pero en realidad nadie estaba pidiendo ninguna entrada en esta √°rea, entraba todo el mundo aunque estuviese abarrotado.\n\nMe esperaba algo mejor.",

There are far too many people, the wait times are out of control, and the workers are friendly but completely lack any sense of urgency. Three employees selling water bottles at a cart, but each transaction taking 3-5 minutes. Mobile order at the restaurant, but then told to wait in line with everyone else to pay for and retrieve my food. It starts down pouring rain (not the park‚Äôs fault, of course) but there are so many people here that no one could move and everyone is soaked. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PLACE.",

Every corner offered something exciting for both adults and children alike.\n\nThe rides and shows were world-class ‚Äì Hollywood Dream, Jurassic Park ‚Äì The Ride, and Mario Kart: Koopa‚Äôs Challenge were just a few of our favourites. That said, the park does get quite busy, especially on weekends and holidays.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing the Fast Track pass. It made an enormous difference to our experience, allowing us to skip some of the longest queues and enjoy more attractions in less time. Without it, we would have spent far too much of the day just waiting in line.\n\nThe staff were friendly, helpful, and well-organised, keeping everything running smoothly despite the crowds. Food options were plentiful with some fun themed snacks, and there were loads of photo-worthy moments throughout the day.\n\nIf you‚Äôre visiting Osaka, Universal Studios Japan is an absolute must, especially with family or friends. Be sure to get that Fast Track for the best experience ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth every yen!\n",

En effet, il a plu et donc toutes les attractions √† sensations fortes √©taient ferm√©es (c'est celles qui m'int√©ressaient le plus). En plus, pas de ticket avec cr√©neaux horaires √† Super Nintendo World. On m'avait dit que c'√©tait pratique, √ßa permet de g√©rer le monde. \nLe parc n'est pas grand et les d√©cors sont bien donc il y a toujours moyen de d√©ambuler, d'avoir des souvenirs et de prendre de jolies photos.  \nPar contre, il y a du monde, beaucoup de monde. Et quand la pluie s'est calm√©e, les attractions fortes ont eu plus de 100 minutes de file d'attente.\n Ah oui, sans l'application, impossible de savoir les files d'attente d'ailleurs. C'est dommage car je connais des parcs o√π des √©crans sont disponibles avec une vue globale sans qu'on en ait √† t√©l√©charger quoique ce soit. \nBref, super parc mais beaucoup de petits impr√©vus qui ont g√¢ch√© mon exp√©rience.

Il est facilement accessible en transport car il a la propre gare. Si vous souhaitez acc√©d√© au Nintendo world il faut arriver les premier, il demande un Qr code 30 min apr√®s l‚Äôouverture juste le temps d‚Äôy aller dans les premiers. J‚Äôai ensuite r√©server un cr√©neaux pour 15h facilement avec l‚Äôapplication.

We went on several rides including Jaws, both Harry Potter rides, Mario Kart and other Nintendo rides, and Minion Mayhem.\n\nHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey was the highlight‚Äîan incredible ride with 3D screens and motion effects that made us feel completely immersed in the Wizarding World. Jaws was also a fun and thrilling experience. While we were excited to explore Super Nintendo World, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations and felt just okay.\n\nThe park gets crowded, and wait times can be long‚Äîso we highly recommend purchasing the Universal Express Pass. It made a big difference and was well worth the cost to skip the long lines for the most popular attractions.\n\nOverall, it was a great day out and a must-visit for families, especially Harry Potter fans. Just plan ahead for crowds and express access to get the most out of your visit.",

Most rides are 40minute + waiting time and in some rides you aren‚Äôt allowed to take a bag or anything else, which is understandable, but in Singapore Heath, queuing for over 100 minutes without water or food is just not right. \n\nAn express pass is $130 per person, again the price is too high for what you get as this theme park is only small. \n\nMy conclusion: to expensive, to busy.",

            text: "Went with family of six on a Friday in August.  Took the MRT to hat outside and then taking 4 escalators up joined the sensors express (Monorail) to the resort work stop.  Tickets for the Sentosa express are 4 dollars per person.  Children U7 free - you can buy at the monorail entrance or simply use your MRT card at the gate to save buying a ticket.  (Return is free - you only need a racket to get out to the island). \n\nArrived at 9:40 at the universal entrance and the queue was quite small - 50 people in each of 6 lines. We entered the park and headed to minions land (we had standard park tickets), and we managed to go on 3 minions land rides in just 75 minutes, amazing as later in the day all these had +50 min ride waits. We then headed to far far away land and did shred 4d and the magic potion spin both within the next hour. \n\nA brief stop for lunch and then back to enchanted airways - but the queue was 60 mins due to so many express pass riders being let in early.  This is a very short ride and not worth the queue.\n\nWe then headed to the rapids (80 min queue), again massively impacted by the fast pass riders being let in first. \n\nIt was 3:30 by this time so a stop for more drinks and refills, before we went on Accelerator, then Lights, Camera Action and a walk in the shops.  We headed back to Cyclon (queue said 60 mins but only took 20 mins - the best ride on the park), and Treasure Hunters. \n\nOn the way out at 6:30 we spotted Transformers 3D was open and made this our last ride of the day.\n\nOverall thoughts: the park is good, more aimed at smaller kids, some rides very similar to small UK theme parks. \n\nPasses/ if you buy a standard pass, it‚Äôs almost impossible to do all the rides you want to go on due to horrendous queues. Some queues were 120 mins and many others were 70 mins.  \n\nIf you buy and express pass there are also rides with queues - rapids was 59 min queue even for the express pass for example (a staff member has a sign warning people).\n\nThe overall experience is that the park is ok, but massively oversold with people. Some of the staff are strict and rude, the prices for food and drinks and super high, and the ride turnaround is slow (single staff members loading cars, operating the queues and also controlling the start/stop slowed things down where it could have been quicker. \n\nTips: take some food and drinks - despite all signs about bag searches we didn‚Äôt see a single bag searched when we entered. \n\nTips: rapids has a singe rider line - use this to save 2 hours of queuing if you can.\n\nTips: you can complete minion land in the first hour if you arrive early.\n\nTips:  barge your MET cars up the day before to avoid having to buy a monorail ticket.\n\nTips:  stay late - the queues get smaller in the last 90 mins.",

Queue times however became very long around 2pm and some of the rides may not have been worth the 110 minute wait! This universal studios is small and unfortunately when i came two of the rides were shut and as there are already not a lot of rides, this limited our rollercoaster experience. My favourite rides were: the return of the mummy, Human, Cyclone and Minion Mayhem. For the bigger rollercoasters you have to put your items in a locker which was definitely different to Florida. I'd advise anyone going to arrive there 15 mins before the gates open at 10 am as we managed to do the biggest 3 rollercoasters within the first 45 mins.",

It's colourful and crowded, but the queuing times of up to 100 minutes for the more popular rides, plus the generic burger and Coke diners etc, and countless gift shops in such a small space make for a claustrophobic day out. Two or three of the rides were closed for 'refurbishment', including the Waterworld show which I remember loving thirty years ago, and there were rather too many Minions or Sesame Street tie-ins. Maybe I'm a grouch but I reckon this Universal franchisee needs a bit of a kick and upgrade.",

            text: "We had a great day out, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but there was some wrinkles that they need to sort really. \nWe had fast pass - good job as pretty much every line was 50mins plus most the day, 110mins for a few key rides. Even with fast pass we waited over 20mins for a few rides. Remember minionland is a supplementary fast pass which we are glad we did not do as that‚Äôs pricey for just 3rides (two of which are smaller child more mainstream rides like a carousel). We headed straight to minions mayhem on arriving at the park for opening (not alone with this trick as it was instantly a 30min wait but did rise to 45 then 60mins whilst we were in line). \nThe queues take a while to get in the park at the start of the day, even with all the gates open, mostly cos there‚Äôs people with issues with their tickets which the staff member sorts with them whilst the queue waits - would be better to have a separate staff member for those with problems to be ushered to keep the lines flowing eg people in front of us had bought fast pass but not bought their actual entry ticket (don‚Äôt make that error). Would be good to have a few more staff members in a few places, would speed things up. Waiting in the Singapore heat is more painful than usual waiting and most lines are undercover but very hot, with occasional regular fans, taking a hand fan useful but for some of the bigger rides you‚Äôve already had to store all loose items in a locker anyway. We were really disappointed the Jurassic park rapids ride was closed, it‚Äôs a big one to be missing. Also disappointed that Jurassic canopy flyers and also nearby treasure hunters are not on fast pass. They didn‚Äôt drop below 50mins queue in our visit even at 6.30 at night. Trolls live performance, shrek 4d are two good places to get an aircon recovery for a while to reset. Watch out if you do the Steven Spielberg making of movie magic near the park entrance, if you are front row right hand side as you look forward then you get soaked, not splashed, absolutely soaked through as a wave comes at you. That made for a very uncomfortable time as there was no air dryers in the bathrooms and the humidity doesn‚Äôt let things dry fast. \nWe‚Äôve done universal in California and also universal in Florida a few times, and we knew this park was much smaller, for the most part the rides that are there are exact same rides, but less dramatic eg minions mayhem without glasses, mummy with less fire.",

It was hot and humid but most ride lines had fans and shade while you were waiting.\nMany rides closed due to rain and thunder warning, with only the inside rides operating at this time - recommend going on the outdoor rides first if it is clear and saving the indoors ones for when it rains. \nWe had a mixed lots of waiting times - Battlestar Galactica was pretty much just walk-on every time (my daughter rode it 4 times!), Puss in Boots and Enchanted Airways had  a long wait, Accelerator was empty (just us on the ride), and Transformers we walked straight on. But all rides had friendly and helpful staff, and were greatly enjoyed.\nWe saw the Waterworld show, which was much better than I was expecting, with the chance to sit down in the shade a welcome break. The Lights, Camera, Action! show was great too, and you learned a lot about special effects.\nThere are plenty of food options, from sit down cafes to street-side stalls with drinks and ice creams. \nWe met the Minions and didn't have to queue too long.\nThere are plenty of shops to choose souvenirs from (most rides exit through a shop).\nAdvice is to skip your photo at the US globe at the entrance until your way out. So many people first thing, but when we left at closing time, we were able to get a photo with just us in it.",

            text: "Just got back from a visit to Universal Studios Singapore and thought I‚Äôd clear up some misinformation I saw in other reviews ‚Äî not because people are wrong, but because things have changed, and most reviews are outdated. Here‚Äôs what you need to know if you‚Äôre visiting as of July 2025. \n\nEXPRESS VS EXPRESS PLUS\nThe main difference now is Minion Land. If you want to skip the queue at the main Minion ride, you‚Äôll need the Express Plus pass. Regular Express doesn‚Äôt cover it.\n\nThat said, even on a busy day, the wait time for the Minion kiddie rides was under 10 minutes, and about 50 minutes for the main ride. Personally, I‚Äôd save the S$30 and just:\n\t‚Ä¢\tBe there when the park opens,\n\t‚Ä¢\tHead straight to Minion Land,\n\t‚Ä¢\tRide the Minion attraction first,\n\t‚Ä¢\tThen use a regular Express pass for everything else.\n\nEXPRESS LINE = NOT INSTANT\nAnother thing: the Express line isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúskip the queue.‚Äù We still waited 20+ minutes at rides like Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers. But hey ‚Äî that‚Äôs still better than the regular 60‚Äì90 min lines.\n\nFREE WATER (SORT OF)\nYou can get free water all over the park from drinking fountains, but it‚Äôs warm. The trick? Ask food vendors for free ice, or use self-service ice machines at larger food courts. Bring your own bottle or cup and boom ‚Äî free iced water all day.\n\nFOOD & PAYMENT\nThey say no outside food or drinks, but no one checked. Having a few snacks and your own water bottle will save you time and money.\nAlso important: The park is fully cashless, so bring a credit or debit card ‚Äî no cash accepted anywhere\n\nWe had a great day, but I do think they oversell the Express pass a little. It‚Äôs still worth it for cutting down wait times, but manage your expectations ‚Äî and skip the Plus unless Minions are a must-do.\n\nPS : Waterworld show was still closed when we visited.",

I also never get tired of the Transformers ride ‚Äî it‚Äôs still one of my favorites.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with my visit to Universal Studios Singapore and I‚Äôll definitely come back again",

            text: "Our family of four (two adults and two boys aged 4 and 10) recently enjoyed an absolutely unforgettable day at Universal Studios Singapore, all thanks to their VIP Experience. From the moment we arrived until the very end, it was stress-free, perfectly organized, and filled with magical moments.\n\nA huge thank you to our phenomenal guide, Dany, who made the day truly exceptional. Thoughtful, kind, and impeccably efficient, he ensured every detail was taken care of ‚Äî from fast-tracking our rides to helping us meet our favourite characters like Toothless, the Minions, Optimus Prime, and Bumblebee ‚Äî all without waiting in line. \n\nDany even had the foresight to make reservations for lunch for us at KT‚Äôs Grill, a calm oasis compared to the busy dining spots throughout the park on a rainy day.\n\nWhen heavy rain arrived, he had ponchos and umbrellas ready and flawlessly rearranged our itinerary, so we didn‚Äôt miss a single outdoor ride. Without being asked, Dany even extended our five-hour tour by an extra hour to make up for the weather ‚Äî a gesture that didn‚Äôt go unnoticed and was deeply appreciated.\n\nWhy We Recommend the VIP Experience:\n‚Ä¢\tPriority Access: Skip every queue, including those not covered by express passes ‚Äî even on peak the day we went which had 15,000 guests in the park.\n‚Ä¢\tDedicated Guide: Our guide handled everything ‚Äî customizing the day to our preferences and ensuring we got the most out of every moment.\n‚Ä¢\tComfort and Convenience: Access to a private lounge, reserved seating at shows, and unlimited express ride access after the tour.\n‚Ä¢\tExclusive Extras: Each VIP ticket included a $25 meal voucher, personalized touches (like our Minion-themed tickets), and exceptional service all day long.\n\nWhile the VIP Experience is a premium offering, it‚Äôs truly worth it ‚Äî especially for families. It transforms a day at the park from a tiring slog through queues into a joyful, stress-free adventure packed with moments you‚Äôll cherish.\n\nThanks again, Dany, for giving us one of the best theme park experiences we‚Äôve ever had. We‚Äôll never forget it.",

To put it bluntly it‚Äôs nothing more than an expensive backdrop full of Instagram hopefuls posing like fools and getting in the way. Average ride waiting time was 70 mins - ridiculous, especially in hot humid weather. Very little for young ones , could they not have put in a wait free splash pad?? Or something to occupy them while other kids wait 70 mins per ride . The place is small , filled with merchandise shops ( as expected) . Wait times on the app where incorrect and some wait time were over 120 mins per ride. It‚Äôs not a fun family day out- it‚Äôs frustrating & disappointing. I have been to Disney land in HK and it is far better run. We should have done the DUCK tour instead- oh well, live & learn. I actually feel like I was robbed it was that bad!",

Some of the rides had a 70min wait, and with an express pass we didn‚Äôt wait any longer than 5-10mins on the busier rides.  I would have spend hours in total waiting or queuing if we didn‚Äôt have it.  A great day out overall.",

            text: "Universal knows how to make a theme park! When comparing to other amusement parks it's clear that a lot of effort has gone into making a day here a great experience. There are so many details that they have streamlined and considered that others miss. Like single-rider lanes for most attractions, always filling each ride, efficient loading/unloading for attractions, etc. We could ride SO much with single-rider, and very few seem to know about it or use it. Use it. Use it a lot!\n\nThe Studio Tour is the star of the show. It's amazing, don't miss it! It's also what separates Universal Studios Hollywood from the park in Orlando. \n\nThe themed lands are great, especially the Harry Potter land. It's amazing to just walk around in it. If you haven't experienced it before it's truly magical.\n\nCharacter meet & greets are very well organized. Characters show up on time on their designated spots and are all acting in character. The small interactions with each visitor is highly appreciated by our children.\n\nOn the downside the park feels a bit cramped. Super nintendo land for example feels like it should have a bigger space and the transformers metro base is just squeezed in without the opportunity for some more theming around it. It didn't help that big parts of the central area was under renovation during our visit. Universal Florida feels more open and as every attraction and land got the space it deserved.\n\nThe transition between upper and lower lot is tedious and easily becomes a bottle neck, even on a day with 20% attendance like when we visited.\n\nParking for $35 is really expensive though, and it doesn't matter if you just want to go to the city walk for a few hours or stay all day, the fee is the same.",

We would have brought a backpack with snacks and water if we had known this. \n-get there early and go to your favorite rides first thing\n-Mario cart had a wait from 80 to 140 min all day, so we didn‚Äôt do it.

Het ziet er super-gaaf uit, maar of het dat geld waard is? Sommige ‚Äòshows‚Äô zijn ook om je geld afhandig te maken. Een show waarin je een toverstokje wordt aangemeten, is belabberd, en enkel bedoeld om je te verleiden om een dure Harry Potter stok te kopen. Verder overal duur en vet en ongezond eten. Het park was superdruk op de donderdag die wij er waren. Overal dikke rijen om 40 minuten tot wel soms wel bijna 2 uur wachten.  Jammer, wat het is echt een heel mooi park verder.",

It was very expensive for not a lot of things to do-you really can do the entire park in less than one day, so the BOGO day free tickets are sort of pointless unless you live in Cali, and then most just have a season pass. We didn‚Äôt have terribly long lines, so that was great.  The whole upper and lower lots was a bit of a hassle with all the escalators and made the park hard to navigate.  We did have a medical issue and had to use first aid‚ÄîI would give them 10 stars for how well they handled the issue.  The rides are fun, but there aren‚Äôt enough little kid/non-rider friendly things to do for how much it costs.  I wouldn‚Äôt go back for how much it costs.  With that said, the park is extremely clean, and the themed areas are very well done.  Mario World and Harry Potter and Secret Life of Pets were family faves.  Transformers terrified my tween child and there wasn‚Äôt enough details or warning ahead of time (which resulted in the medical issue).  I wish we had done Disney instead.",

            text: "Entrance price is similar to Disneyland, but you get a lot more at Disneyland. The best bit is the tour of the actual studio. I was a bit shocked at the sales tactics, an example is the wand shop. A very talented actor makes great play at choosing a wand for a bright eyed six year old, and hey presto he presents this wand (which after a great wait has chosen this one lad) magical........then the parents are invited to have a chat to a staff member where I suspect they are told the price.  At Disneyland photos taken of you on rides are free, here you are offered special deals. My last gripe is that they ask for photo ID, this meant having to bring our passports and I felt stressed at trying not to lose them. Once I entered Guest relations said that photos of our passports would have sufficed, if this is the case why not tell people? Anyway no one actually asked for a photo ID in the end, instead a fingerprint was taken. So why ask for a photo ID in the blurb? Otherwise the park offers great views and so far the rides are fun, ( we're half way through our day here).",

The park is smaller and more compact than Disney, and even on July 4th we didn't wait for more than 20 minutes for any ride (with standard admission - the express pass was too expensive).  We particularly liked Jurassic Park, The Mummy, and the two Harry Potter rides, and very much enjoyed the Water World show and of course the classic tram tour.",

Der Eintritt erm√§chtigt zum Besuch aller Attraktionen. Das Essen ist nicht inbegriffen. Es gibt auch innerhalb des kostenpflichtigen Gel√§ndes (nicht nur in der frei zug√§nglichen City ausserhalb) viele Essensm√∂glichkeiten. Im Sommer ist das Gel√§nde von 9 bis 21 Uhr offen. Es lohnt sich, gleich zur √ñffnung zu kommen. Am Morgen (und dann ab 17 Uhr wieder) sind die Wartezeiten k√ºrzer. Die l√§ngsten Wartezeiten gibt es bei Mario Kart. Das Express-Ticket, mit dem man die Wartezeiten vermeidet, ist doppelt so teuer und eigentlich nicht n√∂tig. Wir waren am Samstag nach 4th of July dort und warteten meist zwischen 10-20 Minuten. Oft wird auch w√§hrend der Wartezeit Unterhaltung geboten, wenn man z.B. durch verschiedene Vorr√§ume kommt.",

Got to the parking around 8am and only waited 10 minutes to pay and park. Was at security by 8:30 and in the park right at 9. Busted down the doors and headed in.\n\nTips:\n\n1. Start at the Simpsons. There was no single rider last time so we started there to be sure. It was so good! Sign said 20 minutes but there was a 4 minute total wait. The ride was my 3rd favorite. \n\n2. Then head to Mummy Returns. We had no wait either. The BEST RIDE in the park as far as the action. #2 favorite ride. \n\n3. Grab a quick snack and get in line for Transformers. This was my #4 favorite ride. It opens at 10 so you‚Äôll get right on. It was OK. It is 3D and since I‚Äôm blink in one eye, the special effects didn‚Äôt work all that well for me. Still great though. \n\n4. Then head to Harry Potter. There are two rides. The outdoor rollercoaster might be the worst ride at the park. No single riders. Usually super long waits. And the ride lasts 2 minutes max. \n\nThe Harry Potter Forbidden Journey is the best ride in the park in my opinion. If you want to see all the cool things wait in the lines because the stuff in the lines is actually really cool. Once you‚Äôve done that, then do the single rider 10 more times. No wait to do that. \n\nThe lockers are free for I believe two hours right outside the ride since you can‚Äôt bring anything one.\n\nFinally we did the studio tour again. It was completely different this time and still super cool. Just because you‚Äôve done it once doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll see the same things.",

            text: "Whatever you might think this is not a studio visit it is a theme park. You need to have children to get the best out of it. You need to Google what rides are available. Of the 4 studios in Hollywood I would rate this4. I have done them all and Warner bros stands out as the best. The Jurassic park ride is excellent but you get very very wet. The mummy ride is completely in the dark and could be anything, poor. Didn‚Äôt do any other rides as they are for kids. The studio tour on golf type carts is excellent and you get to see the well documented jaws thing, crashed aircraft from war of the worlds etc look on utube cus it‚Äôs all old and on here. You learn nothing about how a studio works mainly because they don‚Äôt use back lots much anymore evidenced by none of the sets being dressed. Don‚Äôt buy front of line just go early and no queues at all",

When my family wanted to go I decided I did need to go, specifically because I'm a Simpsons Fanatic and there's a good chance that someday they will tear-down Springfield to make room for another attraction. I was not disappointed. The tour was good, the Harry Potter stuff was cool enough and the Simpsons area was everything I had hoped. The simulator ride was fun and funny, Krusty Burger was a good a place to eat as anywhere in the park, where everything is expensive anyway, and DUFF BEER! Duff Beer Garden and a Moe's Tavern. The beer was on tap and pretty good. It's an American Lager, taste a bit like Budweiser, maybe a little better? One can get a bit of tunnel-vision looking at all the stuff going on, be sure and LOOK UP, there are Springfield Buildings and Characters above the main walkway that people were just walking by obliviously. The Simpsons souvenir shop really got me. I usually avoid those shops when I'm at any sort of Amusement Park, but for the Simpsons nerds, they have tons of cool stuff that you cant find anyplace else... and some stuff you might find elsewhere but will pay more for, especially considering you'd need to have it shipped to you.",

Bello il tour degli studios (disponibile in inglese e spagnolo), stupenda l‚Äôarea a tema Harry Potter. Consiglio di arrivare al mattino ad orario di apertura e di fare immediatamente la fila per le attrazioni pi√π gettonate, Harry Potter e Super Nintendo World. Non sapevamo bene cosa aspettarci dalle attrazioni, sono pi√π o meno tutte simili ma la prima (per noi Harry Potter) √® stata davvero pazzesca e super inaspettata. Per noi, una delle tappe imperdibili a Los Angeles. I prezzi all‚Äôinterno del parco per i viveri sono decisamente proibitivi, come qualunque altro parco simile",

Not a big one for thrill rides but still plenty to see and do. The Waterworld Show was awesome - highly recommend. Harry Potter theming was amazing. The free hotel shuttle was definitely worth using rather than walking up/down a decent sized hill.",

Scooby, Shrek and Fiona - I assume you are there to interact with kids, not ignore and walk away from them (especially when they run towards you and stop waiting for your reaction, while you simply walk by). Scooby run to a disabled child (ignoring everyone on the way) and stayed with them for ages. Understood, but you need to think that not all disabilities are immediately visible and you actually made an autistic child wonder why he was totally ignored and so small in your eyes! Even if you are busy, it‚Äôs not difficult to wave or high-five them if you do need to be elsewhere! Human touch was missing, while we liked the facilities and surely preferred it over Disneyland Paris which is always so crowded!",

            text: "I have not been to Universal in 30 years. I got a gold pass for myself and the Costco annual passes for my husband and two kids. We live in Southern California and this was a year of fun versus one day at Disneyland. We just had our first visit. I wanted to write a review about the things I look for in reviews. I always want to know where I can refill my water. Water fountains in park only. The only water bottle filling station I saw was in the locker storage room in the City Walk area outside the park. Nice setup with bathrooms and water bottle filling station and lockers. We paid $12 for the day to store our lunch cooler and jackets. We decided next time we will just leave it in the car because it is not too much farther from City Walk. We also bought the freestyle cup and just refilled it all day and got water that way when we needed. Great way to have drinks on hand all day.\nLastly, about the backpacks. The Harry Potter ride for example does not allow backpacks because the restraint comes down and there is no place for the bag on your back. They offer small free lockers while you ride the ride but if you have a backpack like us you have to pay the $5 to store it that you don't get back. Bummer. Next time we will bring fanny packs only which were okay and stick our Freestyle drink cup in the free locker while we ride. Food was reasonable. Not any worse than fast food prices for our family of four these days. Especially with the gold pass discount. Next time we plan to stick some pretzels and snacks in our fanny packs and eat in the park and have some food in the car in case we want some more options from home. It was a great fun day. We are glad we have passes because it was a lot to do in one day!",
